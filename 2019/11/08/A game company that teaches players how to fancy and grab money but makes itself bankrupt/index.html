        <p>If someone asks what is the biggest highlight of gta5 online mode, I think most people’s first reaction is to rob Pacific Bank with friends in gtaol. However, from an objective point of view, the robbery task in gtaol is like a large copy. It’s a set of process that how to play after finding out the process and mechanism. If it’s not that the price in gtaol is too expensive, it’s necessary to purchase assets by robbing accumulated funds in the early stage, which is the only way to get money quickly. It’s estimated that no one will try again after being fresh 。<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A game company that teaches players how to fancy and grab money but makes itself bankrupt/ae3a173b15f24536a12b5587d79a6a2e.jpg" alt="A game company that teaches players how to fancy and grab money but makes itself bankrupt"><br>When it comes to “gtaol” and “robbery”, we have to mention the “payday” series, which is often compared with “GTA”. Although the design of GTA for the task of robbery mode is very wonderful, “robbery” is only a small part of the game, while “harvest day” is more pure, because this is a no compromise “robbery” game.<br>The author has been paying attention when the series of “harvest day: plunder” was launched. At that time, it was forced by the conditions, and not everyone had the conditions to experience it. The relevant news of the game was also obtained through various magazines. At that time, the author first saw this very iconic mask suit mob, and for a long time, he was haunted. The success of harvest day has been reported in the magazine for a long time, but my little friend and I can only hope for the success of the magazine.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A game company that teaches players how to fancy and grab money but makes itself bankrupt/771ad5b3e50e41f7b037624974c14f13.jpg" alt="A game company that teaches players how to fancy and grab money but makes itself bankrupt"><br>The four protagonists are representative enough</p>
<p>#The most primitive desire<br>Overkill, a little-known studio from Sweden, formerly known as grin, has been doing the business of helping others to do foundry work before the development of harvest day. The second generation sequel of the classic IP “resurrection of the demons” under Capcom of Japan, the Bionic Commando, was created by them. Although the quality of the game is good, but their business is not good, so it was not long before they went bankrupt, but the members of the original studio still wanted to play games, so they set up a new studio, overkill, with the regrouping of people.<br>Just like their name (super kill), this time they want to do something different. They want to make a FPS game with crime as the theme. In this game, there should be a fierce police and bandit war, a comprehensive game system, and they should draw inspiration from various crime films. If they are a robber, what should they pay attention to in the process of crime Face, how to plan, so this FPS for robbery purposes is outlined, and this game also has a very topical name “payday”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A game company that teaches players how to fancy and grab money but makes itself bankrupt/ddd95b4f2ac14690b45b5673325964ef.jpg" alt="A game company that teaches players how to fancy and grab money but makes itself bankrupt"><br>As a criminal, in front of the flood police, all you can rely on is your partner and the weapon in your hand<br>Christianity once said that human beings are born with “original sin”. It is the root of all kinds of sins, which will lead people into the abyss of sin and make people unable to extricate themselves. Under all kinds of pressures in life, who hasn’t the impulse to be a bad person in the past? In fact, it can’t be said that everyone’s heart yearns for freedom and unrestricted life, but everyone knows that this is impossible, and everyone must abide by the rules of the world.<br>In order to get the release from this depressed mood, we can only get rid of it by other ways. Some people are willing to exercise, some people are willing to go to bars, and most people like to vent their emotions in the game. Therefore, there is a vote of GTA and similar GTA works with crime as the selling point, and harvest day is just looking at this point, and it will be a crime tour The most irresistible part of the play is taken out alone and enlarged, which satisfies the players’ desire in the most direct way: everyone wants money, and you can do whatever you want for money.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A game company that teaches players how to fancy and grab money but makes itself bankrupt/63341988d7e14a508e1cc8492de851bb.jpg" alt="A game company that teaches players how to fancy and grab money but makes itself bankrupt"><br>In the face of so much money, everyone wants to pack an extra bag and take it away, but they may pay for their greed</p>
<h1 id="“Payday-for-you-and-me”"><a href="#“Payday-for-you-and-me”" class="headerlink" title="“Payday for you and me”"></a>“Payday for you and me”</h1><p>Harvest day itself is a four player shooting game like the road to survival. Before committing a crime, players need to go to the target location as civilians to “touch the door” and start planning and implementation after mastering the necessary information. The whole process requires four players to unite to “declare war to the society”. Once the game was launched, it became a hit in a short time, and overkill finally saw their “gold”.<br>As a type of game with sensitive subject matter, there are many popular opinions, such as natural and social disputes, promoting crime and corrupting social ethos. If there is a problem with this game, I’m afraid that all relevant works of police and bandits in the world have problems. This topic is not initiated by harvest day for a day or two. Understand It’s natural for people to understand.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A game company that teaches players how to fancy and grab money but makes itself bankrupt/05b0d35671914a7f99d2874646c51160.jpg" alt="A game company that teaches players how to fancy and grab money but makes itself bankrupt"><br>The success of harvest day: plunder attracted starbreeze, another game company that just started to focus on distribution. At that time, starbreeze was worried about how to make a living because of its limited technical force and poor game quality. The company’s situation was not optimistic, and the success of harvest day attracted starbreeze’s attention When people were not optimistic about harvest day, they saw the potential of overkill and decided to buy the team even if they lost their money.<br>With a new owner and a certain amount of capital, the erratic overkill can finally develop new games in a down-to-earth way. With the help of starwind, only two years later, it launched the orthodox sequel harvest day 2. The sequel greatly strengthened all game systems on the original basis, enriched the game content, and once again achieved a double harvest of word-of-mouth and sales volume.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A game company that teaches players how to fancy and grab money but makes itself bankrupt/df33039d9d3a49ed93f4685f9fb9816b.jpg" alt="A game company that teaches players how to fancy and grab money but makes itself bankrupt"><br>In particular, the quality of the game’s audio-visual BGM is so high that it can’t stop in the process of the game as if it were poisoned</p>
<h1 id="if-you-don’t-do-it-you-won’t-die"><a href="#if-you-don’t-do-it-you-won’t-die" class="headerlink" title="if you don’t do it, you won’t die"></a>if you don’t do it, you won’t die</h1><p>But it seems that the success of the game makes Xingfeng forget the pain. Because the game’s discourse power is basically in his own hands, Xingfeng first planned to plan a large number of DLC schemes for the game, and then added the micro transaction (i.e. opening the box) in the game, which caused many fans’ dissatisfaction. Fortunately, after overkill regained the game’s copyright, the micro transaction was deleted, relying on the follow-up The high-quality updated content of the game maintains the livelihood of the game, but that’s nearly three years since the game was released. How interesting the game is, it’s fresh. Overkill also realized that the vitality of the game should come to an end. It’s time to launch a new work to replace harvest 2.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A game company that teaches players how to fancy and grab money but makes itself bankrupt/26e223c23987449aa7b69d779570fac2.jpg" alt="A game company that teaches players how to fancy and grab money but makes itself bankrupt"><br>If you ask which DLC is recommended to buy, the usual answer is to buy all<br>Although overkill is responsible for the development of the game, it seems that the success of harvest day has limited their imagination. The follow-up new work Raid: World War II is a complete copy of harvest day, and the setting is not rigorous, which has been criticized by the players for a while.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A game company that teaches players how to fancy and grab money but makes itself bankrupt/c3ba7a0e3fff4fb7a575550415508127.jpg" alt="A game company that teaches players how to fancy and grab money but makes itself bankrupt"><br>The setting of “raids: World War II” can’t tell which side of World War II it is<br>Xingfeng always thinks that he has enough capital and starts to focus on all kinds of strange projects. First, he looks at the potential of VR and plans to carry out VR business, but he doesn’t earn much money. Then, he pays a lot of money to buy Valhalla, a sub era engine that no one has heard of. As a result, the new engine can’t be used in the development of the new work. The new work “overkill walking dead” is more direct Published as a semi-finished product, it became a zombie theme game that copied the game of harvest day and played the same trick as Raider: World War II.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A game company that teaches players how to fancy and grab money but makes itself bankrupt/f628dee3ec09416f9a3611169e0b15fb.jpg" alt="A game company that teaches players how to fancy and grab money but makes itself bankrupt"><br>Because of copyright, the digital version of overkill’s walking dead is no longer available<br>The only successful game “killing machine at dawn” is just a novel way of playing. It was copied by other manufacturers, and finally fed other families, but it was cold. Star wind put all the treasure on the walking dead. As a result, if they didn’t play the game well, they just tossed and turned, forcing overkill to take out such things. Eventually, the sales volume didn’t reach the expectation, leading to the bankruptcy and reconstruction of the company, and the direction of overkill was not clear. The employees of star wind said that the pan had to be completely carried by the CEO who lacked leadership.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A game company that teaches players how to fancy and grab money but makes itself bankrupt/2c31b79eb2424ef79116e91840be41cf.jpg" alt="A game company that teaches players how to fancy and grab money but makes itself bankrupt"><br>Which game will carry forward the play method of “kill machine at dawn”, I believe most people know<br>    concluding remarks<br>After nearly half a year’s struggle, it seems that the company’s situation is not improved but more dangerous. Xingfeng is still making plans to reverse the situation after changing to a new senior level. They say that once the financing is available, they can look forward to the future again. It’s really a dying company that can say this. Now I look forward to the release of “system shock 3” for many years, but it seems that developers are not willing to release it on their own, and I don’t know if there will be “harvest day 3” both joined the ranks of “lifetime”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A game company that teaches players how to fancy and grab money but makes itself bankrupt/5110edcccd0248618fcc4b7caf94c641.jpg" alt="A game company that teaches players how to fancy and grab money but makes itself bankrupt"><br>I can’t remember how long I’ve been waiting for this game<br>No matter what the company has done, the author hopes that he can survive this disaster. Although their previous behavior may be a little stupid, it is only personal factors. They hold the games that only they can make, so as not to let those talented gamers bury them, and also to prevent these classic IPS from ever reappearing. I hope that they will have a chance Get back on your feet.</p>
