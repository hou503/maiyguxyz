        <p>When it comes to polish game companies, it’s estimated that most of the players will think of cdpr as a “donkey” for the first time. With its well-made “Wizard” series, straightforward development concept and attentive attitude to serve the players, not only the reputation of the game is surprisingly high, but also the reputation of the company is surprisingly good in the industry, and such game manufacturers even put in the world There are also very few games in the market. A small number of players may know that an independent game company named 11bit has many well received independent game masterpieces such as ice age and this is my war.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A game series with 11 years of history, how to make generations of bad reviews and continue to be new/619a270c5ac2442ab1d95c62b9f923a4.jpg" alt="A game series with 11 years of history, how to make generations of bad reviews and continue to be new"><br>There is such a game company, which was founded almost at the same time as cdpr, and is also of Polish origin. Up to now, the number of games is more than 100, but it is amazing that most of their game evaluations are almost failed, which is called “the worst game company in Europe”. This company is called City Interactive (hereinafter referred to as CI) As the representative of “Sniper: Ghost fighter”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A game series with 11 years of history, how to make generations of bad reviews and continue to be new/c6b0cee290e64ee88abd042aaf6940ed.jpg" alt="A game series with 11 years of history, how to make generations of bad reviews and continue to be new"></p>
<h1 id="sudden-death-at-the-beginning"><a href="#sudden-death-at-the-beginning" class="headerlink" title="sudden death at the beginning"></a>sudden death at the beginning</h1><p>As early as August 2018, Sniper: Ghost fighter released a new work, and determined the actual content of the game at this year’s E3 game exhibition, called Sniper: Ghost fighter contract. In fact, this is the fourth generation of this series. It’s nine years since the first generation of this series was released. For players who haven’t been in touch with this series, just look at the name. They should know that this is a shooting game with the selling point of playing a sniper. Players play a sniper who has experienced many battles in the game and go to all kinds of places alone This kind of scene carries out various sniping tasks. It seems that there are not many styles in the whole game market. However, the name is easy to be confused by the players and the French Ubisoft’s “ghost action” series. I don’t know what kind of works are there in this series.<br>In fact, there is also a reason for this. It’s the same tactical shooting game with the modern background and the core of potential behavior. Obviously, the reputation of sniper series is much lower than that of ghost action series. When it comes to potential sniper games, it’s estimated that most players will think of the same kind of game sniper elite in the other side of World War II background, so it’s very popular It’s understandable that many players don’t know about this series.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A game series with 11 years of history, how to make generations of bad reviews and continue to be new/2bb424fb3ab54b099df52eab8d4ab2ce.jpg" alt="A game series with 11 years of history, how to make generations of bad reviews and continue to be new"><br>Sniper Elite<br>The first generation of “sniper” was born in 2008, with the subtitle “art of victory”. It is an FPS game with World War II as its background. During that time, the linear FPS game was at its peak, with the call of Duty series as the representative of such games, while “art of victory” is also such a FPS game, just fixing the protagonist of the story as a single role 。 The player is going to control a Soviet sniper to engage with the German army in various environments. The highlight of the game is the long-distance sniper and the interaction between weapons and scenes. However, this game has a very excellent theme, and its screen performance is very backward. No matter the game mechanism or the enemy’s AI performance is very poor, and bugs are almost everywhere in the game. According to the integrated evaluation of the scoring website Metacritic, this game only gets a media average score of 36 points (full score of 100), and the player’s score is only 3.4 (full score of 10), most of which are given by the media The evaluation of “bad, not worth playing” is enough to prove how bad the performance of this work is, and Ci’s first attempt on a new subject eventually ended in failure.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A game series with 11 years of history, how to make generations of bad reviews and continue to be new/a848d30ee9ab48a0b075266b917ffb3d.jpg" alt="A game series with 11 years of history, how to make generations of bad reviews and continue to be new"><br>Sniper: the art of victory</p>
<p>In the early years, all the shooting Games launched by CI were based on the theme of World War II, while the art of victory is just one of many works, and the series of Sniper: Ghost fighter we mentioned above is a new series after the background is changed to modern. It seems that CI intends to develop sniper as a series of IP. Ghost Warrior was released in 2010. The background of the game has been changed. Therefore, there are more detailed researches in the design of sniper system, such as the prediction of trajectory, the search for suitable gun points, and the use of props.<br>However, it has been 2010, and call of duty has been released to action black. The game picture performance is still very poor. The character modeling is very rough and the frame number is not stable. Many scenes can only be viewed from afar and not be played, and the frame number drops suddenly a little bit. As a sniper game, the most basic combat system is also unsatisfactory, and various kinds of execution are in progress The action will feel very heavy, and the level design of the game is relatively rough and there are lots of bugs. All these factors make the experience of the game very disturbing and unexpected. The work still failed.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A game series with 11 years of history, how to make generations of bad reviews and continue to be new/b136dd56f36546d7b01954e864fa4a01.jpg" alt="A game series with 11 years of history, how to make generations of bad reviews and continue to be new"><br>Sniper: Ghost Warrior<br>Here is a brief introduction to CI company, which is located in Warsaw, the capital of Poland. It has a company scale of more than 100 people and has branches all over the world. Although CI started late compared with some first-line companies, it developed very fast because of the merger of several companies and full working experience. Before cdpr became famous, this company was The former “Polish state-owned enterprise”. With the support of the state, the company was able to play the game in such a smart way. Only three years later, CI launched the sequel Ghost Warrior 2, and the quality of the game this time was almost the same as or even completely the same as the previous one. However, the official multi player model was not found after the sale, even because of this, many media played for this work The evaluation is lower than the previous one. It’s also ironic that Ghost Warrior 2 is the first third-party game work to adopt cry engine 3, but because it can’t control the difficulty of using the engine, it eventually leads to the unsatisfactory quality of the game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A game series with 11 years of history, how to make generations of bad reviews and continue to be new/99e223ae466f463caf917c8fbb8b3835.jpg" alt="A game series with 11 years of history, how to make generations of bad reviews and continue to be new"><br>Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2<br>And then look at Ghost Warrior 3, which was released two years ago. This time CI decided to go with the flow and change the game to the open world. In view of the problem of the game mode of sniper series and the unsatisfactory arrangement of the task system, many players thought that this time changing to the open world could optimize the game experience, but they still screwed up. The map of the game is very large, but the layout of strongholds is very scattered. Players spend almost half of the time running on vehicles in the process of the game. Although the content and system design of the game have increased, the problems that have appeared in the previous work have been well “inherited” in this work, and as always, they haven’t got the passing evaluation.<br>Many players said that this game is not as bad as the media said, and they are very happy to play. To be honest, if we can ignore the hard problems in the game, the experience of this game is pretty good. After a long-distance calculation, the head of the enemy will be shot off. That feeling is absolutely not available in other shooting games, but we can ignore these problems After all, there are still a few people with problems.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A game series with 11 years of history, how to make generations of bad reviews and continue to be new/3a9ebac261704bcd814cb177706900da.jpg" alt="A game series with 11 years of history, how to make generations of bad reviews and continue to be new"><br>Sniper: Ghost Warrior 3<br>    concluding remarks<br>With the support of the state, CI can insist on the promotion of the sequel under the condition of continuous word-of-mouth. In fact, they are also eager to make works that satisfy all people. However, because the development cycle of the game is short and the development cost is low, they need to save money and other things, so they can only put the quality problems of the game aside for the time being and complete the game as much as possible Rong, that’s why this company has so far over 100 works, but none of them can be called “masterpieces”, let alone 3a.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A game series with 11 years of history, how to make generations of bad reviews and continue to be new/e81ffff943154e6eadd042a3c07ea9ad.jpg" alt="A game series with 11 years of history, how to make generations of bad reviews and continue to be new"><br>To be honest, the author is still not optimistic about the new Ghost Warrior contract, which will be released two years later. After all, the company has no opportunity news or news recently. According to the company’s consistent production level, maybe this time will still be a rotten work. However, there is no doubt about it. In recent years, CI has a trend of jogging with Xiaobu. Although there are many players with such ideas, we all hope that this company can actually hit our face once and make a really convincing excellent work.</p>
