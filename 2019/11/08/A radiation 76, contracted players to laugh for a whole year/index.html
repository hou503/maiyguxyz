        <p>Speaking of the biggest thunder work in 2018, the service-oriented game “radiation 76” not produced by Bethesda, if the players who pay attention to the game at the first time should know that the game suffered a sudden death in the first round, the reputation of media players collapsed, and the quality of the game itself can only be described as “disaster”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A radiation 76, contracted players to laugh for a whole year/f341bccecff54171b99503fe2ea334b8.jpg" alt="A radiation 76, contracted players to laugh for a whole year"><br>It has been nearly a year since the release of radiation 76. During this period, the negative news about community B and radiation 76 will appear almost every other time. It seems that when we are about to forget their “operation of fans”, he will always jump out and brush another wave of existence. The good reputation that B club painstakingly built seems to collapse in a flash, and in the next period of time, it will always bring new jokes to the melon eaters. Throughout the history of the development of video games, no game manufacturer can be as funny as B club.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A radiation 76, contracted players to laugh for a whole year/f395836dfc964856bbf9955b836ee0f8.jpg" alt="A radiation 76, contracted players to laugh for a whole year"></p>
<h1 id="Fallout-1st"><a href="#Fallout-1st" class="headerlink" title="Fallout 1st"></a>Fallout 1st</h1><p>Here’s a brief explanation of the game mechanism of radiation 76. The online mode rules of radiation 76 are the same as those of other multiplayer online survival online games. However, in the mechanism of multiplayer online, it’s similar to the online mode of gta5. Multiple players can live on the same map, and each server can accommodate multiple such maps (or battle situations). Players only If you want to be in the same situation, you can attack other players at will on this map. In this case, it is inevitable that some players who want to play the game seriously will be affected by the players who want to do damage sincerely, so as to form a disorderly and murderous game environment. Therefore, in order to get a good game experience, we just want to kill monsters online with our little friends easily. A considerable number of players have been petitioning B club to launch the service of private server.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A radiation 76, contracted players to laugh for a whole year/8da3e879a49d4ea79321bf438389be2b.jpg" alt="A radiation 76, contracted players to laugh for a whole year"><br>Subscribe to service content<br>On October 24 this year, Club B launched a new subscription service for radiation 76, which was available for players to purchase on the day of release and named “fallout 1st”. Fallout 1st is similar to the senior member pass in other games. With it, you can get the qualification to open the private server, enjoy a carefree game environment, and also get a series of other special benefits, such as infinite space “break down box”, extra discounts and currency subsidies for stores, extra fast travel points, etc. For such a set of services, the monthly subscription fee is $12.99 (about 92rmb), or $99.99 a year (about 706rmb). This price is quite expensive for a subscription service. Considering that the cost of private service is indeed high, some people don’t care about that money and pay out their money, but they find that this service is also like the game of agency B Bug is heavy.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A radiation 76, contracted players to laugh for a whole year/414a342c801940ffa4d4912837e6140d.jpg" alt="A radiation 76, contracted players to laugh for a whole year"><br>Netizen makes stem map<br>First of all, although the private server is only open to friends, it is open to everyone in the player’s friends list. You don’t need to serve the host’s invitation to enter or leave at will. For those players with many strangers in the friends list, “private server” has the same five characters. Secondly, the world created by players seems to have been swept by players. The booty box has been opened, and many NPCs have died for unknown reasons. The material storage box that claims to have unlimited capacity is really “infinite capacity”, and everything put in it will disappear for no reason. It is indeed a “decomposition box” worthy of its name. However, these are just the most influential bugs. There are more bugs that are not mentioned here. What players pay so much money for is a more intimate game experience. The so-called “paying for the crime” is probably the feeling.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A radiation 76, contracted players to laugh for a whole year/61295b6d1ce843eb9f212b2e445628be.jpg" alt="A radiation 76, contracted players to laugh for a whole year"><br>A box worthy of name</p>
<p>#Disaster pr<br>“Radiation 76” suffered a setback at the beginning, so in order to save a little situation, the game directly started to promote at a discount of 70% or 60% only one week after it went on the market. The original price of the game was about 400 RMB, and even 300% of the discount was not achieved. Obviously, this is enough to make those players who bought the game at the original price in advance or in the first round lose blood In response to this, Club B’s customer service provided a subsidy of 500 yuan (about $5) to those players who bought the game at the original price, and this subsidy still needs to be offered by the customer service. More and more people choose to refund, but because the platform where the game is launched is to log in, in addition to the host computer, bethesda.net, so there will be some trouble in the refund process. The first person may have a chance to succeed in the refund, and as more and more people refund, club B suddenly changed the refund policy: as long as the game has been downloaded, there is no refund. This is to annoy a group of players who buy the game, complain and report, and even some people go to the headquarters of B club to ask for a statement. B club can’t resist the anger of the players, so they have to pay back unconditionally and in full.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A radiation 76, contracted players to laugh for a whole year/f2a351cb5a824fb6ad78b32c74bca692.jpg" alt="A radiation 76, contracted players to laugh for a whole year"><br>It’s reasonable to give players a refund, and then slowly repair the content of the game, which should be over, but in addition to the game itself, agency B has a moth in other places besides the game this time: at the end of November 2018, the collection game launched when radiation 76 was released was finally sent to the players. The most attractive gift of this collection is one A power armored helmet is also attached with a canvas bag that looks very delicate and is used to hold the helmet. When players receive the goods, they find that the canvas bag is replaced by a very cheap nylon bag at a glance. The reason given by the customer service of social B is that “due to the lack of materials, the nylon bag is replaced, but this does not affect your enjoyment of this product, which is the most we have ever made Great collection. “ At that time, all the players who bought the pawnbroking version exploded again. However, community B responded to compensate each player who bought the pawnbroking version of the game with 500 atomic coins.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A radiation 76, contracted players to laugh for a whole year/b8a9276e1c9d4ee59037eb082d10e3d7.jpg" alt="A radiation 76, contracted players to laugh for a whole year"><br>Contents of the collection<br>You should know that the price of this collection version is as high as $200, and 500 atomic coins are only equivalent to $5. Moreover, in radiation 76, 500 atomic coins can also buy low-cost skin or decorations that no one will buy. Obviously, this is another bleeding trade. How can players be dismissed like this? What’s more, the media participating in the press conference of Club B even get better free canvas bags than the collection version, so the two sides start to curse again. Club B is really out of temper, and finally decides to let the players who intend to exchange canvas bags register on the corresponding website, and they will send the agreed canvas bags to the players.<br>But it’s just such a simple job that club B can still have problems: every player who goes to register can see the personal information filled in by other players on that registration website, including address, contact information, bank card number, etc., which undoubtedly reveals the content that should be kept secret. Although Club B has repaired the loophole in an emergency, it is undoubtedly a negative part of club B News, even many media have said no words, a canvas bag has let them write so many news.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A radiation 76, contracted players to laugh for a whole year/df60c1c8a9794a51a3f200d9b022969d.jpg" alt="A radiation 76, contracted players to laugh for a whole year"><br>Some players make canvas bags into mod and put them into the game to mock Club B<br>    concluding remarks<br>There are also many ironic news about radiation 76. For example, the fabric inside the complimentary helmet may cause respiratory tract bacterial infection, and Club B can only recall it urgently; players who use mod for the game will be labeled as cheating, and if they need to unseal it, they need to write a review to club B; the surrounding rum launched in cooperation with the winery is not only expensive, but also of poor quality and package The package was supposed to be the same as in the game and turned into a plastic shell wrapped glass bottle.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A radiation 76, contracted players to laugh for a whole year/74c80ee6454c4f7ab3a33f579d1b60ea.jpg" alt="A radiation 76, contracted players to laugh for a whole year"><br>The price is $80. Most players only want bottles<br>Not to mention how the game itself has been updated after this year. At least in this year, we saw all kinds of jokes caused by B club’s carelessness. As we all know, B club has produced the masterpiece of “ancient scroll 5”, which is the level of a 3A overseas factory, but now he makes all kinds of appearances like a clown. All these are attributed to the launch of “radiation 76”, which is not supposed to be launched. It is estimated that B club has been deeply hit by these successive events. I hope he can We can correct our problems as soon as possible and get on the right track. After all, there are so many people waiting for the release of ancient scroll 6 and starry sky.</p>
