        <p>Some time ago, the game circle entered the off-season, and there was a long time between the release of masterpieces and masterpieces. The game I was playing was almost finished, and I also entered a “game shortage” stage. After rummaging through his inventory, he found that there was a “blood source” on the host that had not been touched for a long time, and had never been opened after passing the Customs for a week, while the content of DLC had not been touched at all, so he opened the game on a whim and tried again.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/After four years, blood source is still full of vitality. Is it just dark style/76d72057641c4380950cdfa2a6233b14.jpg" alt="After four years, blood source is still full of vitality. Is it just dark style"><br>Players who have been exposed to the “soul” series of works should know that they can often see in the online mode of the game. At the same time, the virtual shadows of other players in the game can also see the pools of blood left on the ground by other players due to death in all parts of the map, or the messages and prompts left by players in all parts of the map. At this time, it has been more than four years since the game was released, and I am surprised to return to the ancient capital of Yanan again. Even after such a long time, I can still see a lot of traces of other players on the map, especially in the place where powerful monsters occupy, which shows that there are still not a few players who are infatuated with this game If we think about the reason carefully, we can get the answer.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/After four years, blood source is still full of vitality. Is it just dark style/e75b1286142342f6958f8d7403aa938e.jpg" alt="After four years, blood source is still full of vitality. Is it just dark style"></p>
<h1 id="identify-a-“black”"><a href="#identify-a-“black”" class="headerlink" title="identify a “black”"></a>identify a “black”</h1><p>There are not many “dark” style game works on the market, but most of them are very good works. In the early years, the best representative of “dark” is Blizzard’s “dark Destroyer” series. Now, when players talk about “dark”, they will think of fromSoftware’s “soul” series. No matter the spirit of the devil, the soul of darkness or the blood source, they all put a lot of ink on the dark side. Different from the previous magic story style, not only the world view and the game plot are very gloomy and silent, but also the game scene design and the overall color are cold black and white gray. FS’s first console game work “King’s secret order” was launched in 1994, using the popular first person 3D perspective at that time. Since the beginning of this work, FS has adopted a relatively cool and dark game style, which also lays the main tone for a series of “dark RPGs” in the future.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/After four years, blood source is still full of vitality. Is it just dark style/4a13cca896d847608845e83c410df158.jpg" alt="After four years, blood source is still full of vitality. Is it just dark style"><br>If the Kingdom secret order has laid the core playing method and main tone for the company’s RPG game, then FS launched the third person ARPG game devil’s spirit in 2009, which has completely established the overall framework of the company’s future works. It is from the development of this generation of works that a man named Miyazaki YingGAO participated in the development. Without his participation, there might not have been This work, and he also fully demonstrated his talent through this work, maybe sometimes running against the mainstream will not necessarily produce bad results. In any case, for FS and Miyazaki YingGAO, devil’s soul is only a bold attempt. It has been proved that this way is feasible, so they have the opportunity to continue to do it. The subsequent spirit sequel, soul of darkness, can be seen as the “parallel universe enhanced version” of devil’s soul, which has a greater momentum than devil’s soul There is no shortage.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/After four years, blood source is still full of vitality. Is it just dark style/28be30922f4a4dd5b06f79eaf02e4781.jpg" alt="After four years, blood source is still full of vitality. Is it just dark style"></p>
<h1 id="elegance-and-mystery-coexist"><a href="#elegance-and-mystery-coexist" class="headerlink" title="elegance and mystery coexist"></a>elegance and mystery coexist</h1><p>Back to the protagonist of our story, from the secret order of the kingdom to the soul of darkness, the loss of this hardline ARPG series is always based on the medieval magic, and it is inevitable that it will be a little boring after a long time. Even many fans of this series will feel numb in the face of so many works of the same type, so FS needs to launch a new one that can keep the original On the basis of the core, it can also make people feel fresh and fresh. The scene should be more gorgeous, the figure modeling and action should be handsome, and the combat system can no longer hold the shield like before. After several reflections, FS decided to pull forward the time and adopt the Victorian art style and the combination design of Gothic style and kesulu theme.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/After four years, blood source is still full of vitality. Is it just dark style/8ed22f5c50634da98776254c19e67995.jpg" alt="After four years, blood source is still full of vitality. Is it just dark style"><br>It is believed that Victorian and Gothic style is a very romantic and elegant design in the eyes of young girls. Many women like to design magnificent scenes for their films, TV works and games. These designs are very easy to poke their soft spots. If the former “dark” style is applied on this basis, it will be romantic again And elegance pack a layer of mystery and horror, the vast majority of people just look at their eyes will be overwhelmed by it, which is why many female players have joined the “suffering” since the beginning of this work. In view of its own “soul” series have relatively large male loyal fans, “blood source” as a derivative work of “soul” series, he no longer let the players play the “heavy shield” immortal knight, but let the players incarnate the night of full moon waiting for the opportunity to move the devil hunter, light and handsome clothes plus the weapons that can be transformed and various types of firearms to encourage the players to be brave Against the enemy.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/After four years, blood source is still full of vitality. Is it just dark style/ba6969bbb23c49e2a6227d5f03dfa664.jpg" alt="After four years, blood source is still full of vitality. Is it just dark style"></p>
<h1 id="good-experience"><a href="#good-experience" class="headerlink" title="good experience"></a>good experience</h1><p>When it comes to the combat system, I personally think that the battle of blood source is more immersive than the series of black soul, although there is not much difference in the overall thinking, compared with black soul, it is more conservative. “Black soul” provides players with two main ideas of weapon system. One is to use shield or weapon lattice to block the enemy’s attack and draw out space to attack the enemy. The other is to use lattice counterattack to open the enemy at the moment of the enemy’s attack and cause high damage. No matter which one, it seems to encourage players to conduct backhand attack through observation. In the blood source, players are encouraged to use firearms to interrupt the enemy’s attack at the stage of lifting hands to create a hard straightness. Firearms themselves are also weapons that can cause damage. Combined with a variety of weapons that can extend the scope of attack through deformation, players can attack the enemy first. If the attack fails to cause interruption and hard straightness, they can use firearms to “fight against firearms” Attack “,” blood source “in most of the enemies are agile and attack frequency is fast, if the first attack can occupy a great advantage, but only this small change, can mobilize the whole game’s battle rhythm.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/After four years, blood source is still full of vitality. Is it just dark style/646bc69dcebb43de9d90d455c6dac4f4.jpg" alt="After four years, blood source is still full of vitality. Is it just dark style"><br>And the most important thing is that the plot in blood source is relatively compact, and the people are relatively full. You can experience the game completely once, and you can also get a complete story after reading the information in the game. After all, whether there is a sequel is a problem. FS can only simply finish the story in one game, and no longer hide it again and again. Although it is the same work of “dark” series, due to the different background of the story, the creation of the character in this work is attractive both inside and outside, and the human character design is relatively beautiful, but the monster design is still as usual “weird”, which can create a strong contrast for the players, and the monster always gives people a sense of being damned, and if the human makes it For the enemy, it is very good to let the players put their personal feelings into it, so as to feel the delicacy of the game in the invisible side.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/After four years, blood source is still full of vitality. Is it just dark style/cc714d8c53114e64b9971a0e5ec30ba9.jpg" alt="After four years, blood source is still full of vitality. Is it just dark style"><br>    concluding remarks<br>To sum up, these may be part of the reason why the game is still full of vitality up to now. On the other hand, it has a lot to do with the game’s sequel becoming the “lifetime” series. Almost one year after the release of blood, there are calls for sequel every year. “If there is no blood sequel, derivative works are OK, but not blood Go kart is OK. “ Those who like “blood source” may not like “black soul”, but those who like “black soul” will like “blood source” better. In Sony’s press conferences every year, these players have been expecting Sony to bring some surprises to the players. At the same time, every year, some players discover new content of news reports in the play, such as mining game files, exploring abandoned material areas District and so on. It seems that they are so hungry and thirsty that everything in this work seems to have been discovered.</p>
