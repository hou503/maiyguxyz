        <p>At the Sony psx game show in 2016, Sean Leighton, President of Sony global studios, delivered an object at the end of the show. Just as the players were about to take a position with a little regret, Sean suddenly said “one more thing” and said that he would continue to distribute a classic game developed with a new engine. After the end of the video broadcast, the conference would be held End of style. The video shows the green forest, abandoned houses and streets. When a familiar logo slowly appears on the screen, it arouses the screams and cheers of all the audience outside the field and watching the live broadcast in front of the computer. When the title of the last of us: Part II is completed and now on the screen, quite a lot of the audience are in a state of great joy, And constantly give applause and cheers.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Before the release of last survivor 2, we need to know how great it was/7c093e02bda84be2848c087260290717.jpg" alt="Before the release of last survivor 2, we need to know how great it was"><br>Now it’s about four months before the release of “the last survivor 2”, and now it’s more than six years since his previous release. In this period, although some players once thought that the previous open-ended ending setting was unlikely to have a sequel, if it can be renewed, it’s undoubtedly something to celebrate. Since the birth of the series and then to the PS4 platform remake, it is basically defined as one of the masterpieces that must be played by the host, so this time we will talk about how this game can arouse the excitement and expectation of the players.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Before the release of last survivor 2, we need to know how great it was/dd48d08afa0a43b591b6083ca9a40ef7.jpg" alt="Before the release of last survivor 2, we need to know how great it was"></p>
<h1 id="box-sealing-work"><a href="#box-sealing-work" class="headerlink" title="box sealing work"></a>box sealing work</h1><p>In 2013, the mainframe of the last era has entered the end and is about to usher in the next era of update and iteration, but at that time, there were still a considerable part of the functions of Sony’s PS3 mainframe that have not been discovered, so many manufacturers are also scrambling to develop a work that is impressive enough to become the “sealed box work” of this mainframe and win The last “battle” of this generation of mainframe. The final winner of this battle is “gta5” brought by the “ceiling” level R star in the game industry. You should know that in the seven years of PS3’s life, R star only took five years to evolve from “GTA4” to “gta5” of today’s half sky level. The gap between the two is obvious to all.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Before the release of last survivor 2, we need to know how great it was/a44539c1e4c147f4a53268b11815b0dc.jpg" alt="Before the release of last survivor 2, we need to know how great it was"><br>Apart from “amazing”, I can’t think of a better description of gta5 in the same era<br>But Sony’s side is not to be outdone. Its third developer, naughty dog, has also brought a masterpiece exclusive work “the last survivor”. You should know that the naughty dog before this is the only representative work in addition to the series of “the ancient perplexed wolf”, which is the only one of the family’s pillars, and its influence is also one of the best in the whole game industry. And “the mysterious sea area” 》The series focuses on thrilling treasure snatching adventure, with the core of bringing Hollywood action movie level game experience to the players, but this time they want to tell a story seriously.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Before the release of last survivor 2, we need to know how great it was/c83e104951d54cbd8ceeaf3c4a1d46eb.jpg" alt="Before the release of last survivor 2, we need to know how great it was"><br>Mysterious sea area 2<br>Based on the modern background, the story tells of the outbreak of an infection event caused by a mutated fungus in late September 2013. Anyone infected by this fungus called Cordyceps will become unconscious and will only attack and bite other humans endlessly. Joel’s small town in Boston was also attacked by this fungus. Joel had to take her little daughter Sarah to escape in order to survive, but she was stopped by the government army on the way to escape. The government army, adhering to the concept of “killing a thousand people by mistake and never letting one go”, shot the protagonist’s party. Although Joel was not injured, her daughter Sarah Unfortunately, he was shot and killed. In fact, the soldier just obeyed the orders from his superiors, and didn’t want to shoot himself. He was stopped and killed by Joel’s brother Tommy in time, but Sarah’s death was irreparable. With Joel’s plaintive voice in the face of his dead daughter, the game officially began. It can be said that at the beginning of the game, it presented a dramatic performance with a strong impact and a sense of substitution for the players, capturing the players’ eyes instantly.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Before the release of last survivor 2, we need to know how great it was/39f52b83d22542cd8f81b9a5c4fc855d.jpg" alt="Before the release of last survivor 2, we need to know how great it was"><br>The protagonist Joel</p>
<h1 id="different-“survival-game”"><a href="#different-“survival-game”" class="headerlink" title="different “survival game”"></a>different “survival game”</h1><p>After the animation of the film, 20 years later, what happened in this period is unknown to us. We only know that Joel, who lost his daughter, has become more and more cruel and merciless. In order to survive, he can do whatever he wants. It’s easy to kill people and surpass goods. In the past 20 years, the whole country has become lifeless, and the government only governs the people in a relatively tough way at the lowest level. The government’s inaction makes people have the idea of revolt, so a revolt organization named “firefly” has been born. In this country, it has formed its own faction. By chance, Joel met Marlene, the leader of firefly, and in order to To get their weapons back from firefly, Joel made a deal with firefly to send them an “item”: 14-year-old girl Ellie. As we all know, this little girl has a constitution that can immunize against Cordyceps. Therefore, this little girl is probably the key to making a virus vaccine. It is the hope of the whole human future. Because Marlene is injured, Joel is entrusted to send Ellie to the firefly laboratory in another city. The core of the story is the very long journey.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Before the release of last survivor 2, we need to know how great it was/4d6fd8a8c2a2485184a4a6ca623a9393.jpg" alt="Before the release of last survivor 2, we need to know how great it was"><br>The second leading role: Allie<br>“The last survivor” is essentially an action adventure game with survival elements. There are other survivors and “zombies” infected by fungi everywhere on the way. What the players have to do is to find ways to survive in various scenarios and go to the destination smoothly. As a linear game, the playability of this work can not be said to be very high, but because of this very immersive plot and scene design, as well as the vivid characterization, the whole process of the game has a tense atmosphere at all times. Every battle requires the players to be careful. How to manage the materials, props and even ammunition is the key to the game. This is not the first time for naughty dogs to try the game works set by two protagonists. In the past “mysterious sea area”, although the player has been controlling the protagonist Nathan Drake, there is always a good partner who can pull you at a critical moment. This design has been used since the early generation of “mysterious sea area”, and in “the last survivor”, this setting is not only The key of the game process is the direction of the plot.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Before the release of last survivor 2, we need to know how great it was/087a9178552648de88938da88d0c3a71.jpg" alt="Before the release of last survivor 2, we need to know how great it was"><br>In this work, naughty dogs try their best to create a sense of immersion with a high degree of simulation, so many settings and designs are drawn from the real world, even the outbreak of infectious Cordyceps fungus is a real species in reality. On this long road, the change of mood between Joel and Ellie and the emotional transformation between them are the most striking places in this work. Along the way, two people have encountered various difficulties and dangers, chatted and quarreled with each other, from the cold talk to becoming an integral part of their lives. Joel needs a person to appear to save the lost daughter Pain, and the loss of her family since childhood, Allie also needs a person to stand up to guide her in the direction of the future. In this journey, the two people gradually form an interdependent relationship, and perhaps this emotion can only be fully highlighted in a desperate situation, let alone in a world full of despair. From this point of view, both the background and the human settings in the game are almost integrated in a very ingenious way. The plot, human settings and the background form a complementary relationship, which will not only not create a sense of play for the players, but also further deepen the sense of story substitution.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Before the release of last survivor 2, we need to know how great it was/3fd263adad124f1f97e894b8ad933c4d.jpg" alt="Before the release of last survivor 2, we need to know how great it was"><br>Many players will turn on the camera mode unconsciously when they call here<br>    concluding remarks<br>In order to tell a story, they made a game. No matter in plot shaping, plot performance, scene construction or even dubbing and dubbing, the “last survivor” can reach the leading level in the industry at that time. It’s a pity that such a design can’t be made into a movie, but what we need to know is that the video game that can experience is undoubtedly the reason The best way to appreciate things. This kind of story involving human nature and emotion is very easy to impress the audience. If the audience is put into the story together, it will undoubtedly be able to re enlarge the emotional rendering and atmosphere, and it will definitely get a high-quality experience that is several times higher than the movie. For the whole game industry, naughty dogs will undoubtedly promote the movie narrative of the game to a new height again.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Before the release of last survivor 2, we need to know how great it was/d2a452ec88274a4bbfecc323d792435b.jpg" alt="Before the release of last survivor 2, we need to know how great it was"><br>Allie, who always follows Joel, is more like a living existence than an AI. Her impression on the players is no less than that of Elizabeth in biochemist: infinite. Every player who has played “the last survivor” is moved by his touching plot, which is actually one of the models of “the ninth art”. Unfortunately, this work failed to win the best of the year, so his opponent is too strong (gta5). It’s getting closer and closer to the release date of last survivor 2. What kind of emotion can naughty dogs bring to us this time.</p>
