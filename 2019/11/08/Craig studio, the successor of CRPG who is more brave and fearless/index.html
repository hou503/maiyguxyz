        <p>As early as the end of May, a picture similar to the Roman numeral “Ⅲ” appeared on the official website of Larian studios, the developer of the God level CRPG game “god world: original sin” series. So far, two works have been launched. Seeing that the official sends a “Ⅲ” will surely take it for granted that they want to produce “god world: original sin 3”, In an instant, it ignited the enthusiasm of many players who like the series of “God: original sin”.<br>But calm down and think about it carefully. Two months ago, Larian studio just announced that a derivative work called “god world: Hero’s second coming” is under development. How could it be possible to separate some people from Larian’s scale to make the orthodox sequel “god world: original sin 3”?<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Craig studio, the successor of CRPG who is more brave and fearless/507588a91c274cbe8de7e30a33fad483.jpg" alt="Craig studio, the successor of CRPG who is more brave and fearless"><br>As expected, things are not so simple, not that their manpower is not enough, but that the “cake” seems to be bigger than we think. Earlier this month, studio Laran announced the true identity of the new work, a more tearful Name: bode’s gate 3.<br>As a CRPG enthusiast, I believe that many people are as happy as I am, but for most people, it seems that the door of Bode is a very strange name, which is not a strange thing. After all, the release of the new work is nearly 19 years since the release of the previous work, door of Bode 2, but our protagonist is not bode The door, but plans to develop its Larian studio.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Craig studio, the successor of CRPG who is more brave and fearless/d8fde0488aae4e45b28b12fa9d276f02.jpg" alt="Craig studio, the successor of CRPG who is more brave and fearless"></p>
<h1 id="bad-timing"><a href="#bad-timing" class="headerlink" title="bad timing"></a>bad timing</h1><p>No matter from which point of view, CRPG’s hard core system settings and traditional miscellaneous game playing methods can’t please most players, but there is no doubt that CRPG games represented by the “divine world: original sin” series are no longer popular in the game market, but without them, the situation of CRPG may not be as good as it is now.<br>All the way with CRPG to the current Belgian studio Larian is also so erratic. At first, their studio scale was only three people. Since their establishment in 1996, they wanted to make an RPG game. At first, they wanted to sell this game to yadali. Relying on yadali’s fame, they hoped that the game could be exposed in the whole region to improve sales.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Craig studio, the successor of CRPG who is more brave and fearless/0481b8fefcaa44de955d52ffdb64769d.jpg" alt="Craig studio, the successor of CRPG who is more brave and fearless"><br>At that time, yadali was synonymous with video games<br>But who knows that it’s just in time for yadali to withdraw from the game world due to the serious frustration of the E.T. Laran is so stupid that he can’t sell the game to anyone without his owner? Without distributors, the development funds have become a big problem, and the development prospect of the game is worrying. At the same time, attic entertainment, a publisher from Germany, expressed its willingness to pay for them and take charge of the distribution work, and was able to obtain the copyright of “dark eyes”, one of the RPG rules very popular in Germany.<br>It’s good to have new rules, but it means that they have to redo the game in order to apply this set of rules, but the price offered by the developers is appropriate. Although they may be tired, they agree, and the size of the studio has also increased to 30 people, and the game to overthrow the redo is called the lady, the mage and the knight.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Craig studio, the successor of CRPG who is more brave and fearless/b46a2a9e262944fb889b3697c70a9644.jpg" alt="Craig studio, the successor of CRPG who is more brave and fearless"><br>The story of yadali’s collapse is unprecedented</p>
<h1 id="several-turns-in-a-wave"><a href="#several-turns-in-a-wave" class="headerlink" title="several turns in a wave"></a>several turns in a wave</h1><p>Who could have expected that there would be some unexpected events. The sales volume of other games issued by attic, the publisher, failed to meet the expectation, which made them unable to invest more money in Larian. This was very embarrassing. Half of the owners of the game went bankrupt, and the development of the game consumed their own money, so they had to cancel the development of the game, and began to accept the outsourcing work to make a living, At the same time, we need to support the publisher attic.<br>At the same time of outsourcing, they plan to develop a new game and find a new publisher for the game, which is “divine divinity”. Originally, I thought everything could go according to the plan. Who knows that there was a moth on the way. The developers asked them to put the game on the market ahead of time, but at this time, the game was not even finished (like a K Club).<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Craig studio, the successor of CRPG who is more brave and fearless/d5ac9d02dea54a719f41be4204e0e3a9.jpg" alt="Craig studio, the successor of CRPG who is more brave and fearless"><br>Many contents of the divine Kingdom pay homage to his predecessor and old enemy, Diablo II<br>Sure enough, the final version of the game is full of bugs, and the content is not perfect, which makes the game not get a good reputation at the beginning of the sale. With the later updates and patches, the quality of the original plan of the game is brought back a little bit. Because of its unique design concept, this “god world” which pays homage to the old RPG has won many fans for the game. Although the reputation of the game is restored, the twists and turns are not over. The development contract signed by the publisher and Larian limits the amount of royalties they can get. Therefore, although the sales volume and reputation of the game are both good, Larian has not made much money, so they have no money.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Craig studio, the successor of CRPG who is more brave and fearless/c20689c7294f4f5fb58e3dc81e512a79.jpg" alt="Craig studio, the successor of CRPG who is more brave and fearless"><br>Although it’s 2D, the details are rich enough<br>It’s not easy to grow the well run in studio from 30 people back to three people, everything is back to the origin, they began to work in outsourcing for a living. After alleviating the economic situation, Larian released an independent documentary “beyond the divine kingdom” for “the divine kingdom”, which completed the content that could not be completed in the previous work, and also made a warm-up for their new work “the divine Kingdom 2: Dragon descendant”.<br>The development of divine world 2 borrowed the gamebryo engine used in ancient scroll 3 from Bethesda, and created a full 3D action role-playing game. Now, this work is still a very grand work, but who would have thought that history will be played again, and the game will be done without money. It would take another year for the game to be polished, but the money they have is not enough, so they have to put the finished but not optimized works on the market first to earn some of their capital.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Craig studio, the successor of CRPG who is more brave and fearless/efd84fe448204606be8980980a0223ed.jpg" alt="Craig studio, the successor of CRPG who is more brave and fearless"><br>This work and 2012 launched the developer’s clip edition, the single view picture is still excellent</p>
<p>#See the rainbow<br>After the recovery of funds, Larian began to plan to launch a real enhanced version of the game to make up for the deficiency of “divine world 2”. The enhanced version of “divine world 2: Legend of the Dragon Knights” was much better than before in terms of score and reputation, but because the game has missed the best time for sale, so there are not many people who pay attention to it The popularity of an IP is not as good as that of other big works, not to say that even if an enhanced version is produced, it will be robbed by others. For many years, high expenditure and low income have kept Larian on the verge of bankruptcy, which has repeatedly made them have the idea of independent operation.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Craig studio, the successor of CRPG who is more brave and fearless/59138b28e20c4db58c40165b57d891cb.jpg" alt="Craig studio, the successor of CRPG who is more brave and fearless"><br>Larian’s new work “God: original sin” was also put on the studio’s development agenda at this time. Because there was no publisher, they chose to raise funds in the way of crowdfunding on KickStarter, and at the same time, they adopted the development mode of early access (preemptive experience) on steam. Finally, with the help of many parties, the game was successfully launched. As always, there will be a lot of players who know how to appreciate the high quality. At that time, the summer specials of honest steam rushed to the top of the sales volume of the summer promotion in a flash. The hot sale of the game was that they paid off all their debts at once. At this time, they realized that their choice was right.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Craig studio, the successor of CRPG who is more brave and fearless/3a7c27df9f6a405b9a9662fe95a76288.jpg" alt="Craig studio, the successor of CRPG who is more brave and fearless"><br>Although the game is excellent in all aspects, it is not suitable for everyone<br>    concluding remarks<br>I believe that most players know how high the quality of “divine world: original sin 2” is. As an independent game, it almost won the best role-playing award in 2017, challenging the works of many front-line manufacturers. Today’s Laran finally can not live a daily life of fear, and can really be unrestrained to do the games they want to do.<br>Now they have won the development qualification of “gate 3 of Bode”. To be honest, the author has some psychological problems. After all, despite the fact that the “god world: original sin” and “gate of Bode” series are CRPG, they are two games with totally different styles.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Craig studio, the successor of CRPG who is more brave and fearless/39004197f3da4811b754e742fed2ceaa.jpg" alt="Craig studio, the successor of CRPG who is more brave and fearless"><br>The system setting of divine Kingdom: original sin is very close to the people, but even so, it is still a very small work. Many players can’t accept his playing method and rhythm, let alone his depth and difficulty are much higher than that of divine Kingdom: original sin. This is a big challenge for Larian, but the strength of Larian is undoubted. It’s not necessary for them to worry about the quality of the game if they give this IP, but whether they can balance the old and the new era is another problem. I hope Larian can keep CRPG as a game type and keep it from being buried in the historical torrent 。</p>
