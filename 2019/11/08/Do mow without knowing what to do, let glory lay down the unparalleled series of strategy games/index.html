        <p>Nowadays, when it comes to the name “Koei (glory)”, many people may have their first reaction to the famous fighting game “death or life” series, especially to the beautiful girls. However, in any case, tecmo is mainly responsible for the development of the “dead or alive” series. Although tecmo has been merged with glory, it still makes its own games, just like the merged square Enix.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games/f233a80f87b84bc69cacb1173da1030e.jpg" alt="Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games"><br>Apart from the series of death or life, today’s glory also has a special interest in action games. In the past, glory was also a front-line historical theme game factory. In the early years, there were many excellent strategic works such as the wild hope of Xinchang and the age of great navigation. Although they still focus on historical games, they are not only the real Three Kingdoms It seems that there are not many works on other subjects, just like they are dedicated to the Three Kingdoms. However, it is not accurate to say that they are not so dedicated to the Three Kingdoms in the Three Kingdoms, but rather to the “matchless” in the Three Kingdoms.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games/86d42cb3e77c43738e089b95e069da14.jpg" alt="Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games"></p>
<p>#The three countries are unparalleled<br>Few people know that although the themes of the Three Kingdoms originated from the history of China, they are still popular in Japan, and no matter what era they are put in, people who like the three kingdoms are always concentrated in the youth groups. But those related to the three countries, whether books, films and even toys, have good sales volume, which can be said to be a very stable market in Japan. This situation is especially obvious in the early years. The first great work with the theme of the Three Kingdoms was the series of records of the Three Kingdoms launched by Guangrong in 1989. From 1993 to 1995, the series of records of the Three Kingdoms was made in the form of new year’s goods, with a very good sales volume. After that, there are many derivative works, such as the biography of the Three Kingdoms, the biography of Cao Cao, the biography of Zhuge Kongming, etc., but after all, they are all strategy games. Their operation and system make them only appear as a PC game after all. At that time, Japan is close to the host war before the millennium. The PC market can be said to be squeezed by the host and the host games without any survival space Meanwhile, Guangrong naturally knew the current situation, so he decided to slow down the development of “Three Kingdoms” series and try to enter the host market.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games/dcc9fd6e24f049758fb57a806a974a17.jpg" alt="Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games"><br>The peak work “records of the Three Kingdoms 5”<br>In that era, the most popular game in the field of mainframe is definitely action games. No matter 2D or 3D, as long as it’s good enough to play, many people will willingly pay for it. At the same time, fighting games were also very popular in the home computer market. After all, it was a bit troublesome to always run in the arcade in order to play a fighting game. There was a good heat in games such as “Boxer” and “Street Fighter”. Therefore, glory appointed the Omega force studio, which was specially set up to make a fighting game for the host computer game, to make a fighting game, but it should also be explained Shi Guangrong has always been a feature, so the first action game of Guangrong, “the three kingdoms are matchless” was logged into the PS platform in 1997. This is a change of the careful and rigorous style of history. Zhuge Liang, as well as mink Chan, sun Shangxiang and other women who have never been to the battlefield, have also taken up arms to fight against each other. Many players who like the themes of the Three Kingdoms can’t accept such a setting, so the quality of the game itself as a fighting game is acceptable, but the sales volume and reputation are not ideal , once let glory want to give up this IP.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games/4e0ef959d9744b108c71d0e40e697df8.jpg" alt="Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games"><br>1997 “the three kingdoms are unparalleled”</p>
<p>#The three kingdoms are unparalleled<br>Anyone who wants to play an excellent martial general in a Three Kingdoms action game wants to experience the pleasure of fighting bravely in the battlefield. The arcade game “devouring the world: Battle of the Red Cliff” produced by Capcom is the best proof. Many players appreciate this horizontal action game. Glory realized this only after investigating the market, so they decided not to give up “the three kingdoms are matchless” and changed its name to “true three kingdoms are matchless”. They changed the game from fighting to pure action, so that the players could experience the pleasure of playing a military general in a 3D scene. A year before the launch of true Three Kingdoms, Sony launched its next-generation console PS2. At the same time, Sony released the release notice of the game. Many fans of Three Kingdoms couldn’t care about the preciseness after seeing such a scene. 3D plus action, and the huge battlefield built by the soldiers everywhere, just think about it, it’s exciting, let alone true, and it’s all over 。 Because of this, the “true three unparalleled” to a certain extent also led to a wave of PS2 sales, many players are to play “true three unparalleled” (referred to as true three) just bought the machine.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games/f7a1903fc5454b0bbc790698834831b9.jpg" alt="Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games"><br>2000 true, the three kingdoms are unparalleled<br>Although zhensan is a pure single machine, its sales volume far exceeds the glorious expectation, even better than other games launched in the same period, and even the sales volume of Sanguozhi is not as good as it is. This makes glory ecstatic, and decides to attach importance to the “new IP” just launched. Only a year later, glory brought the sequel “true 32”, which coincided with the launch of Xbox by Microsoft at the same time. Therefore, the game also naturally launched the overseas version, which made the production achieve a sales volume of more than one million. Glory has been established for so many years, and never even a game can be as popular as “true three 2”. It’s estimated that glory’s mouth can’t close its smile. They decided to strike while the iron is hot and launch more works as soon as possible. Just like many Japanese games at that time had the habit of launching enhanced version, the company proudly launched the second generation of enhanced version of the work “true three 2: biography of the great general”, adding several new generals, scenes and plots, and still sold more than a million sales, while the glory of winning many times also tasted the sweetness, and decided to suspend the development of strategy games at hand and concentrate on the production of “true three”, er No, it’s the matchless series.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games/f257484583e44f8ca35b7f1591f27c6a.jpg" alt="Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games"><br>2002 “true, the three kingdoms are unparalleled: biography of the great general”</p>
<p>#Three Kingdoms vs Warring States<br>Through the glorious study of the history of the Three Kingdoms and the Warring States period, it was also a change of taste for the players. Later, by launching the work “unparalleled in the Warring States period”, the protagonist was replaced by a famous legendary role in the history of Japan. On the other hand, it met the needs of the people of our country, and the sales volume was relatively good. At the same time, the development of “Zhen San 3” has become the enlightenment work of the vast majority of Chinese players due to the introduction of PC version. This work has greatly improved the playability of the game, not only the weapons have been added to the upgrade system to open up higher challenges for the players, but also the custom generals can be made to fight in the battlefield to enhance the sense of substitution of the game. Various advantages have been widely spread by the players, making this work an indelible classic in the minds of many players. From the beginning of this work, glory not only launched an enhanced version of the game, but also tried to add the political system in the chronicles of the Three Kingdoms. As a result, a different work named “true three: Empire” was born, which allows players to play the king of a country and try to unify the world, rather than simply follow the plot of each force.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games/4496750e1af2404082632ccd548bde44.jpg" alt="Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games"><br>2003 “true, Three Kingdoms unparalleled 3”<br>At this point, almost every generation of works will have the tradition of launching “biography of the general” and “empire”. Even in these derivative versions, derivative versions will be developed again. A generation of works will be sold without knowing how many copies. It will be a bit ugly for the players to have a glorious meal. The Three Kingdoms and the Warring States will inevitably make the players feel aesthetic fatigue. It’s better to mix the two characters together for a big fight, and then make an independent plot for them, which saves time, labor and money. Isn’t it beautiful? Under this assumption, the product is the series of “unparalleled serpent”, which gathers the roles of the Three Kingdoms and the Warring States, joins several new original roles by the way, and lets the heroes of different time and space travel back and forth to fight against the powerful enemies. It is the appearance of this seemingly magical work that officially declares the glory in the field of action games from now on It doesn’t matter to restore history.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games/5780e2a903ac48a1a51b4af019f35d4d.jpg" alt="Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games"><br>2007 the great snake<br>But even if all these characters are assembled, some players will still feel dissatisfied. Even though the series of “double snake” is much better than the other two double works in all aspects, it is always changing soup and medicine. Glory naturally wants to get rid of this dilemma, but how can I make a lifetime of historical games? I really don’t know about other subjects and fields, and I don’t have many famous IPS at hand, so I can’t take out those boaters in the era of great navigation and make them unique? That’s obviously not realistic. And just as glorious as he was scratching his head, Wandai, the infamous “B Consortium” holding numerous well-known IPS, found a door.</p>
<h1 id="unique"><a href="#unique" class="headerlink" title="unique"></a>unique</h1><p>To say which IP is the most expensive in Wanda’s hands, it’s probably a few well-known “gota” series. This time, Wanda found the door of glory, which is exactly the foundation of ω - force’s production of “matchless” series for many years. After all, a game can be sold in several generations and can be bought well. There are not many games in the whole industry. Wanda wants to let glory take his place We make a unique game with the theme of “Gotha”. In any case, Gotha is more popular than that of the Three Kingdoms in Japan. If we launch a series of “Gotha unique” works along the way of “Three Kingdoms unique”, we will surely be able to sell them. The motivation of the ten thousand generations is no doubt equal to sending coals in the snow for glory. The two sides can say that they are on the spot, and then put this unparalleled game as high as IP on the development agenda.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games/1204f11f8b314a4ca54dbc598581b7b1.jpg" alt="Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games"><br>2007 “Kota unrivalled”<br>In 2007, the new series of masterpieces “Gotha matchless” officially went on the market. With the support of the copyright of tens of thousands of generations, glory can’t change it at will, but it still follows the tradition. The story mode is based on the plot of multiple animations, and the overall playing method is much more refreshing than the series of “Three Kingdoms matchless”. After all, the characters have changed from generals to mecha, with strong mobility and various kinds Qingping big kill tool is available, which can almost be understood as the high-tech enhanced version of “Three Kingdoms are unparalleled”. But even if there is no such picture of zagu with thousands of enemies in any of the Gotha series of works, though it is a hot-blooded animation, its core idea is anti war after all. In the eyes of many loyal fans of Gotha, it is very different from the original, so it can not accept such settings in the game. At the same time, due to the relationship of copyright fee, the price of the game is much higher than that of the Three Kingdoms series. Therefore, the sales volume of the game has not been equal to that of the Three Kingdoms series.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games/ec589973ab1043a5885d235a134b7ffd.jpg" alt="Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games"><br>2013 “true Godard”</p>
<h1 id="dying"><a href="#dying" class="headerlink" title="dying"></a>dying</h1><p>There are five works launched in the series, from generation 1 to generation 3, as well as the special edition of generation 1 and “true Gotha” which have not achieved the sales volume of million level. This achievement may be considered as just passing in the eyes of generation 10. After all, the big money they earn is not in the game, but it is not ideal for glory. It seems that the reason is not that it’s a high-end theme, but that “matchless” itself has been playing for too many years. In the next era, the mainframe has begun to appear fatigue. After all, no matter how to change the theme and IP, matchless is always that matchless, unable and always the same. Just like the classical FPs in the early years, it can shoot all enemies on the screen with its own power Generally, it’s cool to play once in a while, and will be eliminated gradually with the passage of time. In the gap between the distribution and after-sales of each generation of “as high as matchless”, ω - force will still launch the “true three” series from time to time, but since the third generation, the series has been on the decline, even to the fifth generation with the best look of human design, its sales volume has fallen below one million.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games/8716c15c407f4bf9aa74dfca0cd032e8.jpg" alt="Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games"><br>2005 “the three kingdoms are unique 4”<br>Starting from the works of three generations later, ω - force will make some adjustments and improvements to some places of the new work of “true three”, such as modifying the game mechanism or combat system, while the five generations can be said to be a watershed, not only the difficulty is greatly improved, the combat system is slightly abandoned, but also the planning changes are too many to be completed when the game is released. It is worth mentioning that this has nothing to do with the development team, But glory is too eager for success. Seeing that the company’s income is not as good as it is day by day, we are not calm down to find the cause of the problem. Instead, we choose to follow the online wind to turn our IP online games, such as the chronicles of the Three Kingdoms ol, the age of navigation ol, and of course, we can’t get rid of the real Three Kingdoms unparalleled ol. These games are basically ghost clothes except for the stop clothes. It’s not a long time since the company’s economy has not returned to a positive number for a long time, and even the merger with tecmo has not been able to recover in a particularly intuitive way.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games/df6a66a1b79e4110a84e4c52c1a01f97.jpg" alt="Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games"><br>It is worth mentioning that the national service of “the true Three Kingdoms unique ol” is still in operation</p>
<p>#Everything can be unique<br>In 2011, after a period of brewing, Wushuang decided to break out. All works of the whole Wushuang series launched new works together. Although it is impossible to reproduce the past scenery, at least it can earn some money. Seeing the former partner’s madness, Wan Dai once again found glory and decided to give him a few more IPS to do, including one of the three giants of long comics, “the pirate king”, with the blessing of such divine IP, the adaptation work “the pirate is matchless” has been missing for a long time, making the matchless series rush to the position of million level sales again, and even once broke through the highest authorized adaptation of matchless series Sales volume. Another version of “Beidou matchless” adapted from the classic comic “Beidou Shenquan” has achieved the expected sales volume because it’s an old comic. This glory is disillusionment. What’s the taste of having a strong thigh hug, so I began to visit other manufacturers, trying to get several significant IPS from them to make matchless series.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games/2990aecebb7e499ab44a7485694bef10.jpg" alt="Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games"><br>2012 unique Pirates<br>Glory visited Se and Nintendo successively, obtained the IP authorization of the brave fight against the dragon and legend of Zelda series from them, and successively launched the brave fight against the Dragon: Heroes and unique Zelda. These works can be said to combine the characteristics of the original works and strengthen the original “mowing” method, so as to make the fight more interesting without losing the original There is a style of work. After that, Guangrong produced the works of “the legend of sword wind” and “the war history of Aslan”, and Guangrong himself was not idle. Referring to the ancient Roman history, he produced “the incomparable of Troy”. It seems that as long as there has been a battlefield or based on the recent battle, all works can be made into incomparable. Glory seems to have been enlightened at one time. Although these are unparalleled, they all have distinctive playing methods. It seems to him that only by referring to other people’s works can we make good things. “Reference setting” seems to have become glorious expertise.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games/e527f2882d684557a70400ee9058a1c4.jpg" alt="Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games"><br>2014 Zelda unrivalled</p>
<h1 id="end-revolution-is-not-over"><a href="#end-revolution-is-not-over" class="headerlink" title="end: revolution is not over"></a>end: revolution is not over</h1><p>Take someone else’s IP to do a lifetime of unparalleled, so glory have you ever thought of the original works? The answer is yes. In 2017, Guangrong produced an all-star fight work that gathered up as many as 13 works of his own, and the name is “no double all stars”. Of course, it is not realistic to put all the characters in 13 games into one game, so each work only takes a few representative characters. This work, like the previous authorized works, has even gone beyond the limit. It refers to the fans’ tendency of game design. However, due to the drastic reform of the combat system, many old fans of unparalleled series are dissatisfied. However, they still choose to buy for the sake of many characters participating in the war, so the sales volume and public praise are very common. After years of work with different themes, Guangrong also has some ideas about his “old guys”. In order not to make the work repeat the same mistakes, they decided to change the new work of “true three”. But what’s most surprising is that they actually made “true three eight” into a seamless and open world.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games/86d83b6c98274db499c9f0f8086817ca.jpg" alt="Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games"><br>2017 no double all stars<br>I don’t have any opinions on the setting of open world for action games, but it’s only limited to linear process games. However, the “true three” series has always achieved fast-paced and intensive battles on a single battlefield scale. Changing to a seamless open world means that each battle will have a long running process like the task in GTA, which will cut off the game experience Split sense, obviously not suitable for the “true three” series, as if the “dragon like” into the turn system general violation. Sure enough, the game has made unprecedented bad reviews after its release, and even once became one of the few “bad reviews like a tide” works on the steam platform. Think about it carefully, this is not only the first time that “true three” uses the seamless open world setting, but also the glorious first time since ancient times to make the seamless open world game. There will inevitably be immature places, but this time The second is that they think everything is too good.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games/dbc3d5e2a06d4c8d8a0e62a32997ceef.jpg" alt="Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games"><br>2018 “true, three unparalleled 8”<br>The failure of “true three 8” undoubtedly hurt the glory and vitality. Fortunately, it was not long before “matchless snake 3” came out to remedy the situation, relying on the relatively good quality of the game, or the signboard “true Three Kingdoms matchless” will probably be so depressed in the future. It’s almost 20 years since the emergence of the first unparalleled mowing works. In the past 20 years, the “unparalleled” series has been brilliant and declined. It’s undeniable that no matter how innovative the series is, it’s still a little weak. Even those “ancient FPS” knew to slow down and make a reasonable innovation before continuing, rather than just making a little modification Put it on the shelf like this. How to rejuvenate the matchless series is glorious. It seems that it will be some time before the next meeting of the new series of “true three”. After all, glory is the new series of “Three Kingdoms” which hasn’t been moved for many years. Look forward to the future performance of this legendary series. What players want to see is definitely not “5S of Goddess strange news”.</p>
