        <p>There is a famous sentence in the Japanese historical science fiction Galaxy Hero Legend: “our journey is the sea of stars”. Until now, people’s exploration of the universe has not ended, and a group of people with the heart of conquering the sea had the same emotion a few centuries ago.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Dream of sailing in the electronic world, past, present and future of navigation games/b69f85736a8d4109a5d6c0c5ae47dccc.jpg" alt="Dream of sailing in the electronic world, past, present and future of navigation games"><br>Li Bai, a literary magnate, has a poem: “when the wind blows and the waves break, it will help the sea.”. Human beings are really a very contradictory race. They are full of fear in the unknown field, but they will feel especially curious and yearning. It is under the influence of this kind of emotion that a group of brave warriors who dare to challenge themselves to conquer the unknown are born.<br>A few centuries ago, it was not very difficult to become a sailor to explore the sea. With the gradual development and improvement of human civilization, this opportunity was not easily available to ordinary people like us. In order to satisfy those who had a dream of sailing but had no chance to go to sea, various related works emerged as substitutes, such as books and Film and television works emerge in endlessly, and it seems that only video games can provide the best experience for people.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Dream of sailing in the electronic world, past, present and future of navigation games/41969235efc94ee1aaab779ec1fc5d4a.jpg" alt="Dream of sailing in the electronic world, past, present and future of navigation games"><br>    past<br>When it comes to navigation, it is estimated that the first impression of most people is sailing, artillery, pirates, which is also the inherent image of navigation games. From the end of the 15th century to the beginning of the 16th century, people opened up sea routes that could connect all regions of the world. These routes promoted people’s communication and exchange all over the world. Along with the rapid promotion of knowledge and trade, they provided a new breakthrough for the development of human civilization. This period is known as the “era of great navigation” in the future. Such a wonderful and interesting historical background can hardly be made into a game. The first one to carry out this work was the glory of the Japanese manufacturers who were famous for developing historical games in their early years. By their hands, the most prestigious and most famous maritime play in the history of the game, the age of great navigation, was born.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Dream of sailing in the electronic world, past, present and future of navigation games/0bddeb361b5043ccbc2ad3657b69a00d.jpg" alt="Dream of sailing in the electronic world, past, present and future of navigation games"><br>The first generation of the age of great navigation was born in 1991. There are six orthodox works up to now. Each generation has an original story based on historical documents. There is no strict task setting in this series. Players can set up their own navigation teams to explore in various cities, trade with them to obtain funds, or launch wars to gain reputation. In the game, players need to master certain knowledge of navigation, geography, management and trade to operate the whole navigation team. At the same time, they also need to often fight with the pirates. Although the immersion of the game is not very strong, but it is a very detailed restore of all the experiences a navigator should have, which has never appeared in the past Games.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Dream of sailing in the electronic world, past, present and future of navigation games/49b1f9aeb06b4155aec293195c41caf5.jpg" alt="Dream of sailing in the electronic world, past, present and future of navigation games"><br>Regarded as the best series of “the age of great navigation 2” by countless people<br>With “the age of great navigation” as a guide, there are many similar games, such as “the great navigator” from the same developer and later “the king of sea merchants”. Although these games are far less famous than “the age of great navigation”, they also have good game quality. Players who like “the age of great navigation” series will naturally take this as an example Some games can’t let go. And even for the manufacturers of glorious historical games, it has always been a big problem whether they can win or not for a long time. Because of the complexity of the system, the development of such games is difficult, and the audience group is less. Therefore, after a long time, no one will develop games with relevant themes.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Dream of sailing in the electronic world, past, present and future of navigation games/914433a93ffe4ebfbd693ac58fd9b708.jpg" alt="Dream of sailing in the electronic world, past, present and future of navigation games"><br>The follow-up “king of the sea merchants” has excellent pictures but general public praise</p>
<p>In addition to glory, now there is another game company that focuses on historical themes called Ubisoft. Its aerial historical theme action game “Assassin’s Creed” has been astonishing since its birth, but now it is still the most commercial IP of Ubisoft, none of which. As we all know, “Assassin’s Creed” is the most popular one in the series, “Assassin’s Creed 2”. Its trilogy complements the complete adventure story of a generation of Assassin master ejio. With the passage of the plot, the game time also advances. The three generations have jumped from the demise of the Byzantine Empire to the American War of independence, which means that the era of great navigation has ended and the navigation industry has been relatively mature, So in the game, there are some parts of the bridge section of sailing for naval battle.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Dream of sailing in the electronic world, past, present and future of navigation games/6a2d0690f4094facb930194ca9762f05.jpg" alt="Dream of sailing in the electronic world, past, present and future of navigation games"><br>The sea battle system of assassin creed 3 is more experimental<br>This setting gave Ubisoft a lot of inspiration, so in the fourth generation, time went forward for nearly a century, and put it in the 18th century of private plunder, which belongs to the golden age of pirates. “Assassin creed 4: black flag” sets the protagonist as Edward James KENWAY, the grandfather of three generations of protagonist Connor, who was just a sailor on a pirate ship before becoming an assassin. The game puts the story in the West Indies between the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, and the protagonist is a pirate, which means that there will be many elements of navigation. In addition to the general linear tasks, the players can also upgrade and transform the protagonist’s love ship “jackdaw” at will to perform all the activities that a pirate can carry out.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Dream of sailing in the electronic world, past, present and future of navigation games/5c8dcdfa8a7048fa9457aa9ad848b8d6.jpg" alt="Dream of sailing in the electronic world, past, present and future of navigation games"><br>Assassin creed 4: black flag<br>Players can rob every ship they see in the game, and they can form their own caravans to trade around the world, especially for the part of naval battle, no game can match it up to now. In addition to sailing, players can collect sailors for the fleet in various towns, collect treasure maps and find treasures scattered around the world, and sing with other sailors when sailing freely. Several main NPCs in the game refer to the famous pirates in the historical records, and shape them with flesh and blood. The players can experience a pirate story with great sense of substitution in the game. Although the game is far less than the era of great navigation, black flag is definitely the best comprehensive navigation game on the market at present.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Dream of sailing in the electronic world, past, present and future of navigation games/395ea3498f8f483c9db582f4d94769f5.jpg" alt="Dream of sailing in the electronic world, past, present and future of navigation games"><br>Part of the boarding battle was quite enjoyable<br>     future<br>In 2018, Microsoft quietly released a multiplayer online game “the sea of Thieves” with the same theme of pirates. It is worth mentioning that the developer of this game was the “FPS innovator” the developer of 007 golden eye “, which means that they have quite mature experience in the development of first person perspective games, at least on the surface. In the past navigation games, the main operating object of the players is the ship, or the people of a ship, and there has never been a navigation game from the perspective of a single person on the ship. Perhaps in the view of rare, only from this perspective can we get the best navigation experience, but in fact, it is not so much a navigation game as a pirate simulation Device “.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Dream of sailing in the electronic world, past, present and future of navigation games/03da0c4395544f38ac5a73c44db3586f.jpg" alt="Dream of sailing in the electronic world, past, present and future of navigation games"><br>In “the sea of Thieves”, the operation of the sailboat also needs to be meticulous to the individual because it mainly focuses on multi people online. It needs to be steered, controlled by someone, fired by someone and guided by someone. Even if the hole at the bottom of the boat leaks water, it needs to be repaired by someone. In a word, it is very difficult for a person to operate a huge sailing boat smoothly. Although this setting is novel, it sacrifices the experience of playing the game. The system in the game is too detailed, so it is very tedious to play. Although the game has an excellent sense of substitution, if there are no friends, the experience of the game will be very poor. Rare shows a different design scheme for the players and the industry to reduce the threshold for more players to contact this type, but it also proves that this attempt is meaningful with practical actions, but it has not much reference value.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Dream of sailing in the electronic world, past, present and future of navigation games/50e3c50a17314a329fa1b57565b8ae17.jpg" alt="Dream of sailing in the electronic world, past, present and future of navigation games"><br>It needs to be combined with a lot of common sense<br>Since then, I haven’t seen any other navigation games. It’s undeniable that although the theme is interesting, few people are willing to enjoy the pleasure of navigation quietly in this impetuous era. The market downturn also leads to the fact that the theme is only a very small theme.<br>Concluding remarks<br>The attempt of “the sea of Thieves” on the first person multiplayer online is completely consistent with the true spirit of navigation, which is undoubtedly risky, but whether it can be successful or not needs to be verified by the market. Obviously this time they failed, but they are not sure that they can find a better solution in the near future. At least in the way of experience, people have found a way to create the best game experience, and also have a high-quality game mode, hoping that this category will not be buried by the market in the future. After all, there are not many games that can experience the conquest of the sea on the market.</p>
