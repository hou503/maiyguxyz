        <p>On October 26 this year, EA, a US first-line game developer and publisher, released a small video on the official twitter. In the video, a cup printed with the logo of ealogo appeared, and the cup was slowly steaming with no words. Many netizens began to speculate that EA was hinting to the outside world that it was about to return to valve’s steam platform, and in the test version of steam, they could see several EA games exclusive to original platform of EA.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/EA returns to steam after eight years, and orange is really going to rot this time/fe3b4393a8f5404985f7f0a709ac5a83.jpg" alt="EA returns to steam after eight years, and orange is really going to rot this time"><br>On October 29, EA officially announced to cooperate with steam again, and is ready to bring its own game subscription service EA access and several masterpieces back to steam platform, such as battlefield 5 and apex hero, which will be officially launched before 2020. As soon as this news came out, a group of melon eating players were both excited and couldn’t help laughing. On the one hand, they were able to get rid of origin’s bad experience. On the other hand, it reminded the players of the scene that EA decided to leave steam eight years ago.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/EA returns to steam after eight years, and orange is really going to rot this time/d52065482066443d87626ce230d1f255.jpg" alt="EA returns to steam after eight years, and orange is really going to rot this time"><br>    protest<br>In 2011, EA’s most popular game was battlefield 3, which used a new engine to create a sub era level picture and a shocking modern battlefield atmosphere. Many players were looking forward to battlefield: Rebel company 2 as an excellent performance of practical nature. Many players also thought that this generation’s works should not be too big Problem. While players are holding their fingers and waiting for battlefield 3 to be released, EA announced that the work will not log on steam platform, but on origin platform which is about to be launched.<br>Players have said that EA’s wings are hard and they want to fly. Some people are not optimistic about this new platform. After all, this platform only has EA’s own game, while others say it doesn’t matter. As long as they can play on a PC, it doesn’t matter which platform they log on to. However, no matter what choice they make, the players begin to speculate about the reason why EA chose to leave steam. Some people say it’s because of sharing, some people say it’s just that EA has expanded. When another EA game, Longteng century 2, came off the shelves, EA finally explained this.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/EA returns to steam after eight years, and orange is really going to rot this time/8c1327bc1c14405b9243e99d3c233cb7.jpg" alt="EA returns to steam after eight years, and orange is really going to rot this time"><br>Battlefield 3<br>In fact, EA didn’t leave steam for any so-called sharing reason. When EA and steam negotiated battlefield 3 to log in to steam platform, V club said that it would limit the ability of developers to provide direct technical support for players. Simply speaking, developers are not allowed to use their own clients in their own service-oriented games, update and upgrade all contents and patches And DLC need to be released through steam. If you have played the online service-oriented games such as warframe and thunder of war on steam, you can understand better. After steam starts the game, it starts the game client, through which players can get news, activity and other information as well as push the updated content. Steam is not allowed to appear at that time This kind of client has never had this policy in any game platform before, which makes EA feel strongly dissatisfied. In a fit of rage, EA decides to take off several big works of its own, and no new game will be handed over to steam agent while establishing its own portal.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/EA returns to steam after eight years, and orange is really going to rot this time/6be85994b32f458385cc734d6bcce503.jpg" alt="EA returns to steam after eight years, and orange is really going to rot this time"><br>The second century of dragon</p>
<p>In the early years, EA has occupied half of the country in the three fields of “gun car ball”. There are world-class well-known IP towns such as FIFA, top flying car and battlefield. These works have a large and stable player group, so even if you choose to fly alone, you can have a good time. The original origin was a menacing one. The number of users in the world almost matched the steam platform with 50 million players. Apart from the complete monopoly of their own games, as a game platform, it will naturally act as an agent for other manufacturers’ games. EA’s move is undoubtedly to separate some users of steam, and in the face of this situation, community V is helpless.<br>Origin platform is nicknamed “rotten orange” by players in China, largely because the platform experience is too messy. The update and download of the game and even the landing can be too slow without accelerator, which makes players doubt whether there is a problem with their own network, but it is undeniable that this does not affect origin in the global market At the beginning of this year, it attracted more than 50 million players with an “apex hero”, which is still rising.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/EA returns to steam after eight years, and orange is really going to rot this time/3659453d08254dce9d545d25ed16db3a.jpg" alt="EA returns to steam after eight years, and orange is really going to rot this time"><br>Heroes of apex<br>However, in recent years, it seems that the news about EA is mostly negative, mainly around the design and quality issues in some games, such as the “pay 2 win” of the original Star Wars: Frontline 2, the low completion of the first launch of “battlefield 5” and “hymn” and the low handling of external hook, which directly affect the origin platform core The activeness of the heart players not only makes the evaluation of the game plummet, but also the platform gets involved together. In addition, the use experience of the platform is not increased, which leads to the infinite amplification of the negative image of EA.<br>The closest game manufacturer to origin is Ubisoft, France. Many of its games are sold on the origin platform. There is no doubt that the two sides support each other. But the EA’s return to steam may be a big problem for Ubisoft. In recent years, the division of Ubisoft’s game platform has always been a matter of steam’s opposition. Since the end of March this year, its works have basically stopped landing on the steam platform, and instead joined the epic platform next door, which is tit for tat with steam. Compared with EA, it’s a walk away and a return. The positions of both sides may fall into an awkward situation.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/EA returns to steam after eight years, and orange is really going to rot this time/2c78f386a0a749dea249219b9d2d8008.jpg" alt="EA returns to steam after eight years, and orange is really going to rot this time"><br>Hymn<br>According to EA, the New Star Wars Jedi: the fallen samurai, which is about to be released, can now be pre purchased on the steam platform as the first game to be returned to steam, and the most popular EA access game subscription service will be returned together with the game. Only this member subscription service under EA is highly praised and can be enjoyed at will for only $5 per month Thanks to the many products released by EA, the price of this subscription service is the cheapest among all the existing subscription services. After all, this subscription service is only for their own games, but the series like battlefield and FIFA are also very attractive, and steam has become the fourth platform with EA subscription service.<br>As for the online problem of platform after logging in steam, EA indicates that steam account can be bound with origin platform. In the initial stage of game setting, the origin platform initiator needs to be installed, and after setting, the game can be started directly from steam. Players between the two platforms can communicate with each other, so the server should be provided by EA. Players who wish to join steam’s VAC system can get rid of this idea.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/EA returns to steam after eight years, and orange is really going to rot this time/9d7672a2756e48b587f41790d1a093c3.jpg" alt="EA returns to steam after eight years, and orange is really going to rot this time"><br>Star Wars Jedi: the fallen order<br>    concluding remarks<br>For players, EA’s return to steam is undoubtedly a good thing to celebrate. After all, they can purchase games and online in a more convenient way in the future, without worrying about origin’s messy network experience. However, there are advantages and disadvantages. Landing in steam will undoubtedly further expand the player base of its games, and the increase of player base must be the decline of the environmental quality of the game, whether it is overcrowding or external problems may occur more frequently. However, in any case, looking forward to EA’s return to steam’s performance, G Pang seems to be trying to attract more big game companies such as Bethesda and Microsoft. Maybe this is the V club’s counterattack against epic.</p>
