        <p>If we talk about RPG Games in the early years, we believe that many people’s first impressions will come up with famous game works such as ancient scrolls, Bode’s gate, etc. players who like Japanese RPG should think of “the brave fight against the dragon” or “Final Fantasy”, and those who are interested in martial arts themes may think of “immortal sword”, “Xuanyuan sword”, etc Domestic RPG. This is not a different thing, after all, in the early years RPG Games although there are many masterpieces, but back and forth on so many game companies are doing, for this small market can be said to be in a monopoly state.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Eight years of three game gorgeous transformation, why is there still someone blowing Wizard series/c5ccdca56c2341fda0468eaaaf47b0fc.jpg" alt="Eight years of three game gorgeous transformation, why is there still someone blowing Wizard series"><br>If you talk about RPG Games, you may have to give up an extra position in the above list, which belongs to the wizard series from Poland. When talking about the name “Wizard”, many players may reach a consensus in their hearts, such as “conscience of Polish donkey industry”, “Wizard 3” is the best in the world “and other praise words. When a new open world game appears, someone will compare” Wizard “with it, and almost all the people who have played it will say well. As for where to say it again Not last so, maybe you can only feel it after playing.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Eight years of three game gorgeous transformation, why is there still someone blowing Wizard series/8b6b75c36a0c4988a4a9ce032712f6fd.jpg" alt="Eight years of three game gorgeous transformation, why is there still someone blowing Wizard series"></p>
<h1 id="“demon-hunter”"><a href="#“demon-hunter”" class="headerlink" title="“demon hunter”"></a>“demon hunter”</h1><p>The first generation of “Wizard” game works was born in 2007. The game is adapted from the local novel of the same name in Poland, “the witch”. Although this novel has a small position in the local literature field and won many awards, its popularity is not very high. It seems that some people in the game company CD project (CDP) like this work very much, which is detailed in the game The setting of world outlook and the unique magic theme of the middle ages were fascinated, so they decided to set up a development team to develop an RPG game based on this novel. Early CDP mainly made a living by acting as game software in the local area, but what they did was not only to import the game from overseas and sell it directly in a new package, but also to provide detailed localization work for the game, packaging the game into a new version from the inside out, and making some excellent gifts for the entity game through independent consultation, so as to make every game Box games are worth more.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Eight years of three game gorgeous transformation, why is there still someone blowing Wizard series/46f0bcc7e5974b66b947e936866b34ae.jpg" alt="Eight years of three game gorgeous transformation, why is there still someone blowing Wizard series"><br>The gate of Bode<br>As for why they did this, it was largely because the development of the Polish electronic game industry at that time was not very good. They just wanted to impress the players with sincerity, so as to attract more people and build a good reputation for themselves, so as to achieve sustainable development. The most famous and popular game they represented in the early stage of entrepreneurship was the door of Bode produced by BioWare. Therefore, the company’s cognitive concept of RPG was greatly influenced by this game. After obtaining the authorization of “demon hunter”, the development of the game is in the charge of its CD project red. At first, the play method of the game is similar to that of “gate of Bode”, and it is also operated by clicking. For a 3D large-scale RPG game, this play method is somewhat inconsistent. Many game publishers do not approve the game, so cdpr decided to Overthrow and redo the whole game, and consult with our best partner and idol, BioWare.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Eight years of three game gorgeous transformation, why is there still someone blowing Wizard series/35e9a85c6605411a8bcf8ea02543e4cb.jpg" alt="Eight years of three game gorgeous transformation, why is there still someone blowing Wizard series"><br>CD Project Red</p>
<h1 id="craftsman-spirit"><a href="#craftsman-spirit" class="headerlink" title="craftsman spirit"></a>craftsman spirit</h1><p>In the early generation of wizard, BioWare was used to develop the aurora engine of night without winter. BioWare also provided guidance and technical support for cdpr in the old friendship, so we can see the current series of wizard. In essence, the wizard series and the 3D dragon and dungeon series of the same period play the same way. They just talk to NPC everywhere to do tasks, kill monsters everywhere to upgrade, but they firmly catch the players’ eyes with the huge volume and full name of the play, and create a very wonderful plot with the support of the original novel, To this day, many fans of the series still think that the plot of the first generation works is the best. Huge text volume and real-time calculus performance, rich game content, huge and beautiful open world, all of the original RPG games he had, all of them did not have, but the reputation is too small, so this work is not as well-known as the original novel, but the word-of-mouth of the game is really excellent.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Eight years of three game gorgeous transformation, why is there still someone blowing Wizard series/a00d4b6317c04fff96b585c934c5c45b.jpg" alt="Eight years of three game gorgeous transformation, why is there still someone blowing Wizard series"><br>Wizard<br>By the time of the Second Generation Wizard 2: King assassin, it was only four years before the game was released, and the game had been strengthened in all aspects. For players who have played wizard 3, if you go back to Wizard 2, you may feel that the main character of the game, jarot, doesn’t like the shape very much, but in terms of the screen performance, even if it’s put on now, it’s not bad, or even better.<br>This time, cdpr independently built the red engine by its own strength. The development of the engine and the development of the game are almost synchronous. However, due to the lack of experience, the optimization of the first version of the game and the bug problem are mostly, but the normal play of the game is basically not affected. The game uses non-linear narrative, and there are many sensitive elements to avoid. Even a small game has to create a decent, all of which is to make the story of the game more real. Regardless of the setting of the background, no one can easily understand and indulge in the story, and there will be no distant alienation in other overhead settings Sense, in wizard, there are not too many ritualistic passages, nor deliberately modified lines and dialogues. It’s like telling a story in vernacular, but the story is still too wonderful.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Eight years of three game gorgeous transformation, why is there still someone blowing Wizard series/87e0b8565fbd4ee7b5ac77799b64b3eb.jpg" alt="Eight years of three game gorgeous transformation, why is there still someone blowing Wizard series"><br>Wizard 2: King Assassin<br>The three generation work “Wizard 3: Wild hunting” further draws on the failure experience in the previous work, and adds more reasonable and rich content while modifying and strengthening, such as strengthening the detailed performance of the game, introducing an original small game. Although the physical effect of the game and the interaction between the role and the scene are not very good, it is nothing for “Wizard” A small problem that hurt Daya. The reputation of wizard 3 is so good that I don’t need too much explanation. But let’s put aside the phenomenon and see the essence. Wizard 3 is also an open world game. Opening the map also has dense icons and task points. As a work of story before continuation, the previous stories need to be understood by checking the brief introduction, which is very exciting by reason Headache design will even directly affect the overall experience of the game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Eight years of three game gorgeous transformation, why is there still someone blowing Wizard series/900d427d353743a8bfdb44356ff7273a.jpg" alt="Eight years of three game gorgeous transformation, why is there still someone blowing Wizard series"><br>Wizard 3: Wild hunting<br>Of course, cdpr can’t fail to notice this, so most of the interactive content scattered on the map in the game basically doesn’t repeat, and the repeatable tasks are uniformly placed on the bulletin board for the players to pick up by themselves; in order to avoid the players’ confusion when facing a “familiar stranger”, different dialogue options can be used for the shortest and fastest way The way to understand the story background, and these options are the choice of the player to see or not to see. In short, in addition to the game’s bugs and optimizations and other force majeure, the game itself provides a solution to every problem that the player may encounter in the game, such as the multi field archive that can be saved at any time, the skill tree that can be added points first and then matched, and the dialogue and transition that can be fast forward and skipped. These subtle designs can provide a very comfortable game experience for the player Except for the unsatisfactory combat system, the whole experience of the game really can’t find any fault.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Eight years of three game gorgeous transformation, why is there still someone blowing Wizard series/8713e161282748b487e97fd61fb49269.jpg" alt="Eight years of three game gorgeous transformation, why is there still someone blowing Wizard series"><br>The game world is more real and natural than before<br>    concluding remarks<br>To sum up, the game has repeatedly polished craftsmanship, continuous improvement of self-improvement, wonderful stories that are close to the people and meet the public taste, and good game experience, all of which make the game obtain a high evaluation. As for whether the game map of the game is open enough to see, it is a secondary bonus item, no matter whether it is not affected, but better. They have not forgotten what is the core of an RPG, nor their company’s core spirit since their start-up, that is, player first. The wizard series has opened the door of the international game market with a sincere attitude and promoted the whole Polish game development industry. The state holds its works as “national treasure”, and it is not unreasonable to regard the company as a state-owned enterprise.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Eight years of three game gorgeous transformation, why is there still someone blowing Wizard series/993c4744e8524c098ef54e929d0ff54c.jpg" alt="Eight years of three game gorgeous transformation, why is there still someone blowing Wizard series"><br>The sequel is regarded as “blood and wine” sold by DLC<br>Of course, many people like this game, maybe because of the personality charm of jerotte. Maybe we players need to know more about his story than himself. His story is complete and full, and has a fairly good ending, which makes him deeply impressed in the mind of the players. Just like other games that have become the protagonist, we don’t play him, It’s more like witnessing his every experience and growth from a friend’s perspective, so we can have this unspeakable feeling with the players. As a video game, the wizard series may have its greatness reflected in this, such a game deserves to be blown out, and we also hope that the cyberpunk 2077 will not forget its original intention and go to a higher level in the near future.</p>
