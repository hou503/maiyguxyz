        <p>Pixel wind, in the eyes of many people, is a kind of art style that is both retro and childish, but in the eyes of many game developers, it can be accepted by the players in a very people-friendly way, and at the same time, it can show some unique beauty that can only be presented by pixel wind without losing tension. With the pixel style, this game means that every moving thing in the game needs the author to split the animation into one frame for creation, which is no less tedious than the modeling of other 3D games. In the independent game of pixel style, Fez, teraria and other games are the leaders.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Experience the fantasy adventure created by myself, and trigger the independent game bright traveler of the industry/8b07f04d3dad4c0c87e7a84a171cdf66.jpg" alt="Experience the fantasy adventure created by myself, and trigger the independent game bright traveler of the industry"><br>If you want to succeed as a pixel wind independent game, you can either have fun online with your little friends, or you can win the attention of the players by relying on your outstanding creativity and quality. Even so, there will be some unlucky people who don’t have this blessing. Even if they are well-made, they still can’t get too high popularity. Most of these works are called “good or not”. Today’s story’s protagonist “the bright traveller” is such an existence, and behind the scenes of this game, there is a unknown story.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Experience the fantasy adventure created by myself, and trigger the independent game bright traveler of the industry/908c6b0086d94fc08d906572e417edaf.jpg" alt="Experience the fantasy adventure created by myself, and trigger the independent game bright traveler of the industry"></p>
<p>#”Gao Fu Shuai” in pixel world<br>The bright traveler, released in March 2016, is a retro style action role-playing game in which the player will play an unknown brave against the dark forces in a damaged continent and explore the unknown secrets hidden under the continent. The main process of the game is divided into roaming on the big map and exploring into the underground maze or palace. This kind of playing method is very similar to the early “Legend of Zelda” series. The mode of the game is basically the same. There are many places worth mentioning about this game, and each place can be called “the finishing touch”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Experience the fantasy adventure created by myself, and trigger the independent game bright traveler of the industry/268f57a855ba4dc1b48d1bc1389a990a.jpg" alt="Experience the fantasy adventure created by myself, and trigger the independent game bright traveler of the industry"><br>Although the 16 pixel wind is used in the game’s screen, the details of the screen can be circled, such as the particle effect of the lightsaber in the protagonist’s hand when cutting hard objects, and the blood effect of the enemy when dying. The overall style of the game has the feeling of post apocalypse. There are not only various ancient civilizations and ancient relics, but also various elements of science fiction. For example, various science fiction electronic laboratories and mechanisms, lightsabers and light guns in the hands of the protagonists, etc. form a very magical style between them. It will be weird when viewed alone, but when put together, it will feel weird all blend into one harmonious whole.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Experience the fantasy adventure created by myself, and trigger the independent game bright traveler of the industry/b39a844f5f7147fd953516c0f72895ae.jpg" alt="Experience the fantasy adventure created by myself, and trigger the independent game bright traveler of the industry"><br>There are two biggest two points in the game. One is that the perspective and core playing method of the game are very similar to the legend of Zelda, and the hard words are most like the triangle power of the gods. But unlike Zelda, the fighting system in the game is in a refreshing and fast-paced style. The weapons and their own attributes of the protagonist cannot grow, so the damage of the weapons and the blood volume of the enemy are always fixed Yes, it’s the same as the Zelda series. In the later stage, players can use chips to unlock more actions and moves to deal with various situations, such as using lightsabers to rebound the enemy’s long-range attacks, using fast penetration skills to instantly approach the enemy and inflict damage, etc. with a good sense of attack, players can feel quite happy fighting experience.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Experience the fantasy adventure created by myself, and trigger the independent game bright traveler of the industry/be0bbf26f3044fb89363c96114d6c27b.jpg" alt="Experience the fantasy adventure created by myself, and trigger the independent game bright traveler of the industry"><br>The other highlight is that there is no dialogue in the full name of the game. The full name of the game is only expressed in the form of images. Even when talking with NPC, there are only a few pictures. What happens requires players to supplement their own brains. No text will appear in the scene or even in the UI. Only some hints on the operation will be expressed in the form of text, so even if There is no Chinese in the game and it does not affect the normal play. Combined with the stories and details of each NPC in the game, we can arouse the players’ reverie. From the two minutes of the opening but without a dialogue, we can know what the protagonist seems to be looking for. He has a relatively serious disease, which seems to be to cure his disease and take a risk. Every time after the fight with boss, the protagonist coughs up blood and faints to the ground. There is always a feeling that he will die at any time. This is not the need of the plot, but the author of the game deliberately for it, because he has the same experience as the protagonist of the game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Experience the fantasy adventure created by myself, and trigger the independent game bright traveler of the industry/8f8b6fc5098a4955bb1a0764f12912e3.jpg" alt="Experience the fantasy adventure created by myself, and trigger the independent game bright traveler of the industry"></p>
<p>#It’s not fun<br>The author of “the light traveler” is Alex Preston. All the passages in the game about the protagonist’s death at any time are deliberately implied by him. Because he has congenital heart disease, his purpose is to express his emotion wandering on the edge of death to the players. Alex had suffered from open heart surgery since he was a child, and a few years later he put a pacemaker on his body. He needs to go to the hospital to check his heart every six months. He needs to pay great attention to his diet and take a lot of pills on time. He knows that he may die at any time carefully. Alex is an art major, and he has been fond of video games since childhood. His cousin Ryan Amos and Alex usually do the most things together, that is, play games together. One day, he had a strange thought. He said that he didn’t know how long he would live, so he might as well try to do something to share it with the world proud before he died. After communicating with his cousin, he had the idea of making a game. But he didn’t want to do it carelessly. Since he wanted to do it, he had to do it like that.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Experience the fantasy adventure created by myself, and trigger the independent game bright traveler of the industry/a1714c361d6e4f6e9b6496b3553cdb3c.jpg" alt="Experience the fantasy adventure created by myself, and trigger the independent game bright traveler of the industry"><br>With the help of his cousin, Alex got to know Bo Blythe, a pretty good programmer. The two decided to start the cooperation because their views on many aspects met at once. The game gradually became a serious project from only a few sketches at the beginning, and with Bo’s contact, they met another programmer, teddy diefenbach, which was their whole team. Thanks to his family, friends and doctors who treated him, Alex decided to name his team “heart machine” and began crowdfunding the game with KickStarter. The game’s crowdfunding target is $27000, and after a month, they raised a total of more than $645000, which made Alexei and his team ecstatic. This not only enabled the game to be completed, but also helped expand the scale of the game and recruited several more people to work together. In the end, the game was successfully sold, and in just a few days, it earned a million level of revenue. With its excellent operating touch and unique art design and style, it won the praise of the players. Today, the praise rate in the store is about 94%.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Experience the fantasy adventure created by myself, and trigger the independent game bright traveler of the industry/831225a243e444b9aae6762c421a0bc1.jpg" alt="Experience the fantasy adventure created by myself, and trigger the independent game bright traveler of the industry"><br>    concluding remarks<br>It is worth mentioning that the game has announced the upcoming adaptation of animation at the beginning of this year. Alex has never felt so happy in his playing days. After finishing the work, he still wants to keep going until the end. Playing games made him get to know more people. They had a common goal but had different topics, which made Alex’s daily life less painful. At the same time, many players in KickStarter paid attention to whether their players sent care and greetings, which made him get a lot of comfort in mind.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Experience the fantasy adventure created by myself, and trigger the independent game bright traveler of the industry/def652be231149d59d55cb7529dc5b8a.jpg" alt="Experience the fantasy adventure created by myself, and trigger the independent game bright traveler of the industry"><br>For the final product of this game, he himself has expressed his satisfaction. At least his purpose of trying to convey his ideas to the players through the game is to achieve it. For him, perhaps integrating the pain of life into his daily work can make him unable to choose to escape, but can become his motivation.</p>
