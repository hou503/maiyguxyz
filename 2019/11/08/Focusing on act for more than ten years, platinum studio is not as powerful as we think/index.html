        <p>At this year’s E3 game show, Nintendo announced that the exclusive action game “astral chain”, an ns platform exclusive action game created by platinum studio, will be released on August 30 this year. According to the technical strength of platinum studio, we don’t need to worry too much about the quality of the game, but I don’t know why, it seems that not many people are optimistic about the game. The reason is that although the game is hung with the brand of “platinum products”, it doesn’t seem to be as attractive as expected, but it seems that many people have forgotten that this work is platinum work Room for a few original IP, and from the emergence of an original IP has been five years.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Focusing on act for more than ten years, platinum studio is not as powerful as we think/7671511290c246f697ec3d74afaf03d5.jpg" alt="Focusing on act for more than ten years, platinum studio is not as powerful as we think"><br>I have a white gold studio’s die loyal powder around me. Basically, every work produced by white gold is bought and blown, but for a long time, it has almost reached a state of brainless blowing. There are not a few players who like platinum studio, but anyone who mentions this name knows that the action game it produces has unparalleled quality. It’s not how strong platinum is, but its far-reaching reputation doesn’t allow us to live up to others’ expectations. Under the gorgeous appearance, we only know how much we have suffered and how much we have suffered.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Focusing on act for more than ten years, platinum studio is not as powerful as we think/68d631f341db47bd82bfab511c18fb1a.jpg" alt="Focusing on act for more than ten years, platinum studio is not as powerful as we think"></p>
<h1 id="extraordinary-birth"><a href="#extraordinary-birth" class="headerlink" title="extraordinary birth"></a>extraordinary birth</h1><p>When it comes to platinum studios, we have to mention several of its promising co founders: Sanshen, Shengu Yingshu and Daoye dunhi. Third, samurai is the former head of the fourth game development department of Capcom, known for relying on the terrorist shooting game “biochemical crisis” series, so it has the title of “the father of biochemical crisis”. Shengu Yingshu and Daoye dunhi were also members of the fourth Development Department of Capcom. Apart from biochemical crisis, the most powerful act “ghost cry” and the classic reasoning decryption game “reverse referee” were also created by them. They can be said to be a pillar level general under Capcom’s empty hands.<br>That’s when “biochemical crisis” has come out to “code Veronica”, and “biochemical crisis” series has been unknown in the whole game field. At that time, it was just when Nintendo NGC and Sony PS2 were in a fierce battle. Because of the same aspiration and excellent function, we decided to let “biochemical crisis” series completely monopolize the NGC platform.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Focusing on act for more than ten years, platinum studio is not as powerful as we think/d50c666b29dd4979884517fed720362a.jpg" alt="Focusing on act for more than ten years, platinum studio is not as powerful as we think"><br>From left to right: sanshengsi, Shengu Yingshu, Daoye dunhi<br>No one expected that such a surprising decision would be made in the third meeting. Originally, everyone thought that the biochemical crisis series would have a bright future, but in fact, the sales volume of biochemical crisis 0 newly registered in NGC was only 400000. Depressed three times expressed their dissatisfaction to the outside world in an interview: “PS2 and heart of the kingdom can sell Japanese brains in such a bad way…” this caused public opinion in the society, but even so, unwilling three times made several games on NGC, but failed to succeed. In succession, the three losers were “voluntarily resigned” by Capcom and assigned to the four leaf grass studio to develop games and no longer serve as minister, while the main leader of the four leaf grass was to launch the divine Valley Yingshu of “ghost cry” for Capcom.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Focusing on act for more than ten years, platinum studio is not as powerful as we think/139b7bc4fc1848c9a40bcebbbcdda79b.jpg" alt="Focusing on act for more than ten years, platinum studio is not as powerful as we think"><br>After being transplanted to other platforms, the sales volume of “biochemical crisis 0” became considerable<br>After joining four leaf grass studio, he was still loyal to the NGC platform. He produced five games for NGC, including Joey the red man and hand of God, but he still failed to make any dazzling achievements. The reason is that Nintendo’s console sales volume is low and the studio’s experience in marketing and distribution is insufficient, so that no one will go to the game if it is any better Attention and purchase, the final work order was dissolved at the end of 2006, and several creators also chose to leave Capcom.<br>After “running away from home”, several people chose to set up their own doors and set up seeds studio, but the problem also came up: without Capcom, they didn’t know what to do, and if they wanted to do other game series, they had to spend money to buy authorization, but they didn’t have money, and even if they depended on reputation to sponsor, they would not publicize it, which made several people who set up the company have no way for a while, and they happened to have no way Sanbingda, who left from Capcom, also set up the company’s odd. The same experience made them feel sorry for each other. They decided to merge the two companies one after another. The company also changed its name to platinum</p>
<h1 id="“I-want-to-write-a-miserable-word”"><a href="#“I-want-to-write-a-miserable-word”" class="headerlink" title="“I want to write a miserable word”"></a>“I want to write a miserable word”</h1><p>After the establishment of the company, Sega came to the company and hoped that platinum could develop a series of games for it. They were willing to pay for sponsorship and distribution. How can platinum, who is short of money, let go of this opportunity and sign the R &amp; D budget of five games at once. Then we have the well-known “angel hunting witch”, “crazy world”, “infinite route”, “absolute conquest” and “magic 101”. Although these IP addresses are all original IP addresses, none of them belong to platinum itself. After all, Sega is the gold owner of the game. Even though many of these IP addresses have great popularity and sales volume, it has nothing to do with platinum itself. After all, there are no publishers. Even if Platinum wants to play games, there are no conditions. They can’t make their own decisions on this matter.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Focusing on act for more than ten years, platinum studio is not as powerful as we think/fb0f79c84aa34af99ecda786e7260592.jpg" alt="Focusing on act for more than ten years, platinum studio is not as powerful as we think"><br>With the success of several games and the reputation of several producers, platinum studio soon became the focus of attention. From the moment of being concerned, platinum studio stood in a position far beyond others, which means they have no way back. In short, it’s like a person standing at the top of a pyramid. A little down two steps can also be called a step back. So in order to maintain this dignity and avoid repeating the same mistake again, platinum chose to break his teeth and swallow them in his stomach. In 2016, there were only more than 50 people in platinum studio, but in the past ten years, it has launched a total of ten works, and there is no repetition. On average, there will be one game in the next year, which can only be described as amazing efficiency.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Focusing on act for more than ten years, platinum studio is not as powerful as we think/352c276c91c245e28167cdd8bbd02faf.jpg" alt="Focusing on act for more than ten years, platinum studio is not as powerful as we think"><br>Platinum doesn’t want to belong to its original IP, which is certainly impossible. How can they be willing to work for others all the time when they are of extraordinary origin? This belief is not only rooted in the hearts of several creators, but also carried out by the employees. After “absolute conquest” was launched, the founders Sanshen and sanjuda chose to leave, with one of the founders, Daoye dunzhi, as the head of the company. When the company changes its leaders, it is obviously unable to solve the company’s dilemma. The only way out is to change the company’s owners by holding their thighs.</p>
<h1 id="tail-dead-cycle"><a href="#tail-dead-cycle" class="headerlink" title="tail: dead cycle"></a>tail: dead cycle</h1><p>There are two works that really bring about a turnaround for the company. One is the new project “rise of alloy equipment: Revenge” initiated by Xiaodao Xiufu in that year. Although this work is a second-class product in the eyes of orthodox fans of alloy equipment, it can be said that this work is in the history of alloy equipment, relying on the action design originally learned by platinum in his hometown kapukona and the forerunner’s lesson of “angel Hunter” The most gorgeous and successful transformation.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Focusing on act for more than ten years, platinum studio is not as powerful as we think/dc4c1c4e66e448a8beb2d86f3a436f60.jpg" alt="Focusing on act for more than ten years, platinum studio is not as powerful as we think"><br>The success of two pure action games in succession made platinum finally find its own position and have the confidence to dare to try. It seems to outsiders that the action games they made are also quite reassuring. Se, seeing the strength of platinum studio, came to the door without asking and gave them a dusty IP to make. This is the second work Neil: machine Age of arms. How hot is the game? It is the success of the mechanical era that gives platinum a chance to breathe a sigh of relief.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Focusing on act for more than ten years, platinum studio is not as powerful as we think/35cd5ff026b245f4a3ecb4ed35d345cc.jpg" alt="Focusing on act for more than ten years, platinum studio is not as powerful as we think"><br>For more than ten years, platinum has been either outsourcing or negotiating outsourcing. At the same time, it needs to build high-quality games, and at the same time, it needs to earn money to support itself, and it also wants to earn money and fame. But how can it become a first-class developer and 3a game if even qifandu is a problem? All the way down, platinum doesn’t know how many companies it can’t keep up with. If it wants to succeed, it needs to do original work. If it needs money, it needs to hold other people’s thighs. Platinum hasn’t been able to get rid of this dead cycle for a long time.<br>In 2016, platinum said that it must launch its own new IP in three years. Today, three years later, it has fulfilled this promise, but it seems that at this stage, it can not arouse the strong attention of players. No one knows how far platinum will go in the future. As for the score of this answer sheet, we can only wait until the game is released.</p>
