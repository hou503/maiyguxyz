        <p>In 1977, an unknown science fiction film was released in the United States. This film is a rare space war theme on the market. Almost none of the whole film from the director to the actor can be called “Star”. In the early years, due to the proliferation of science fiction works, people did not have much interest in this work from the beginning. But it didn’t come to pass. After the movie was released, it caused huge repercussions. The high evaluation of the explosion made it directly refresh the box office record of American films, and later became an indispensable part of American popular culture. Until now, its influence is still high. This is star wars, a popular and meaningful name.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/For more than 40 years, what kind of game has Star Wars never tried/eb58990b2cfb44419ba5f0f0779638d3.jpg" alt="For more than 40 years, what kind of game has Star Wars never tried"><br>Film and television adaptation works have always had a relatively easy market, especially in the early years of the home computer platform special honor to obtain a relatively ideal market, and “Star Wars” as a very influential work is naturally unable to jump out of the fate of being adapted into a game. As a science fiction movie with a huge world outlook and many elements, it can be made into a game by picking out any action element in the movie, and Star Wars does, and it still hasn’t stopped until now.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/For more than 40 years, what kind of game has Star Wars never tried/af4375c30db040c09eb0d72b9f1f36c4.jpg" alt="For more than 40 years, what kind of game has Star Wars never tried"></p>
<h1 id="scenario-reproduction"><a href="#scenario-reproduction" class="headerlink" title="scenario reproduction"></a>scenario reproduction</h1><p>If we want to talk about all the video games of Star Wars since ancient times, we may only talk about half of them for a while. Star Wars was born in the 1970s, when video games and home computers were even in their infancy, and most of the Star Wars games were logged into the arcade platform at that time, which was pushed by yadali company When I came out of Atari 2600 home game console, there was a great wave of console games at that time, and various kinds of game works emerged in an endless stream, no matter the first party or the third party. According to the available information, the first Star Wars game was born in 1983. It was five years after the first movie was released, so the game was named Star Wars: Arcade edition.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/For more than 40 years, what kind of game has Star Wars never tried/2b8456850d12446d97ba7ed4cf8ddc5b.jpg" alt="For more than 40 years, what kind of game has Star Wars never tried"><br>Yadali 2600<br>Due to the limitation of its function, the game scene of yadali 2600 that can get the best performance is space. It only needs a black background and a few white dots as stars. This is a perfect space scene. Draw a color straight line at will, which is an exciting light. Therefore, yadali is particularly fond of space themed games because they can make more Focus on adding other effects to the scene. This transplanted “Star Wars” game also sets the game background in space, and it is a first person simulated flight driving work. Setting the scene in the first film of the rebel resistance to the attack of the Empire, it’s hard to achieve the perfect arcade restoration in yadali, but fortunately, it’s only a flexible perspective The Pseudo 3D effect is realized by lines. In addition, the game of yadali generally requires the players to play their own imagination, so this work also creates a fairly good game experience for the players.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/For more than 40 years, what kind of game has Star Wars never tried/c45bbdba1ed04d4982c00997d23f0fd7.jpg" alt="For more than 40 years, what kind of game has Star Wars never tried"><br>Star Wars: Arcade Edition<br>Since then, most of the games on the yadali platform are basically to restore part of the bridge in a movie, and most of them are flying shooting. They are basically transplanted from the arcade, but they have different playing methods and modes. Then came the period when Nintendo dominated the hegemony, the game picture became better, and the capacity of the game was larger than before, so the host of Nintendo has the ability to realize the process of using a game to restore a movie completely. The first “Star Wars” game of Nintendo FC platform was born in 1987. It restores the whole story flow of the first movie with the type of horizontal action passing that became the trend at that time. However, I don’t know why this game is only released in Japan. It is worth mentioning that in this work, there are also some first person flying shots of the Millennium Falcon in the horizontal movement process, but the experience is not very good. Although this work is the beginning of a new era, it does not have a good performance.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/For more than 40 years, what kind of game has Star Wars never tried/5a2af121563741e38156d59df90e5238.jpg" alt="For more than 40 years, what kind of game has Star Wars never tried"><br>FC Star Wars</p>
<p>#New ideas<br>Since then, the vast majority of Star Wars games are basically horizontal action types, and according to the release time of subsequent films, almost every movie has been adapted into a game and landed on most of the game consoles at that time. Most of the highlights of these games are the same, except that players are allowed to control the popular characters in the game, or restore the famous scenes in the movie on the basis of horizontal action. They have basically the same modeling design and game music with the movie, and the level design of the game is relatively good. But the only constant is the difficulty of the game. Since the first work on FC, more than ten works have this relatively high difficulty, which can’t be blown black. Although the difficulty of the current game is generally low, even from the perspective of that time, these games are still not very simple works.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/For more than 40 years, what kind of game has Star Wars never tried/9fa6e3c1cd9b4810a14cd7a08ce8e42d.jpg" alt="For more than 40 years, what kind of game has Star Wars never tried"><br>SFC Super Star Wars<br>As time goes back to the 3D era, 3D images make the game more expressive and create the feeling of coming to the movie bridge. For the first time, players can attack enemies at will with lightsabers and blasters. At the same time, it seems that players are tired of adapting the game, so many manufacturers choose the world view of Star Wars Design original plot. Among them, the Star Wars: Samurai of the Old Republic series launched by the legendary RPG developer BioWare is the representative. There are three works in the series, two of which are stand-alone and the other is MMORPG. The game adopts the semi instant turn system. The plot design is based on the original film and is written independently. With the development experience of “door of Bode” and “night without winter” in the early years, The plot performance of “samurai of the Old Republic” is definitely the biggest plus item of the game. Although it is controversial in the eyes of some players, the quality of the game is beyond doubt, and it won the best game of the year.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/For more than 40 years, what kind of game has Star Wars never tried/ea4de4d126e240c29e9a085de4895a32.jpg" alt="For more than 40 years, what kind of game has Star Wars never tried"><br>Star Wars: Warriors of the Old Republic<br>It seems that after entering the 3D era, Star Wars has really found the most suitable position for itself, and finally ushered in the most glorious period. As one of the largest popular cultures overseas, in order to be able to accept new fans, Star Wars has also tried various changes, such as launching the online game “front line” series, which supports multiple people, and is suitable for young people “LEGO Star Wars” series and so on. It seems to many players that “frontline” series is the most suitable game type to restore the movie experience. However, due to the recession of business, LucasArts, who controls the game copyright of “Star Wars”, was dissolved by the parent company Disney, and then the copyright was handed over to ea. EA made the “frontline” series come back to life again, and “Pro family” by itself Son “battlefield” series of scale development, will “Star Wars: front line” to create a game scale no less than “battlefield”, the same is a large battlefield, also is the same multi habitat joint operation, and use their own frost engine development, with no less than the effect of the film, it seems that “Star Wars” finally ushered in the game industry should have the attitude.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/For more than 40 years, what kind of game has Star Wars never tried/c8138eb3884748b4a6ac1dd1f49ca851.jpg" alt="For more than 40 years, what kind of game has Star Wars never tried"><br>Resurrected Star Wars: the front<br>    concluding remarks<br>However, everything came a little late, and the loyal fans of Star Wars series are no longer as many as they used to be. The discussion enthusiasm of movies and games is far less than ever. Even though the quality of the front line of Star Wars is better, it has not been able to maintain the enthusiasm for a long time in front of battlefield. However, in Star Wars: front line 2, due to the problem of micro trading, it has been directly lowered The evaluation of the game, only a short time after the sale ushered in the promotion.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/For more than 40 years, what kind of game has Star Wars never tried/6ff6345a392e4589b3cdb48dcc01b6ce.jpg" alt="For more than 40 years, what kind of game has Star Wars never tried"><br>Star Wars Jedi: the fall of the order<br>Although for the old fans, “Star Wars” may not be as dazzling as it used to be, but he has never left, just waiting for the fans silently, the movie is, the game is. Now the new work of star wars will return to the traditional single player game after many years, and it will be a very popular “soul like” game. Star Wars Jedi: the fall of the samurai is in charge of the rebirth entertainment of Titan fall and apex hero under EA, at least in terms of the quality of the game, but this is also rebirth entertainment joining EA After that, I tried to authorize the development of the game for the first time, and it was also their first non FPS game. I hope that this time I can have a stable play. In fact, the setting of Star Wars is very suitable for the “soul like” game, and there are few companies that can play the game for Star Wars.</p>
