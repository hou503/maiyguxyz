        <p>Nintendo has always been the name of “playful Games”. Although Nintendo may lag behind its competitors in the development of hard technologies, Nintendo can always stand out from the rest of the world through absolute creativity and popular game design concepts, proving to the whole industry that they can become “the master of the world” only by virtue of game performance ”, after all, the premise of making a game is that it must be fun.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From disdain to participation, Nintendo has also been labeled as a mobile giant/c65cb048c5ed4db8b4494439c4c2bbb0.jpg" alt="From disdain to participation, Nintendo has also been labeled as a mobile giant"><br>In fact, Nintendo didn’t plan to do mobile games at first, even with some disdain. Now, Nintendo has launched seven mobile games, and its Baoke menggong has no decision-making power The company has launched a number of mobile games through one IP, and each of them has outstanding quality and achieved great success.<br>     clean stream<br>Since around 2012, the development technology of many kinds of mobile digital terminals has soared like a rocket, and various digital intelligent products have sprung up. The open and closed battle between various manufacturers reminds me of the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union decades ago during the cold war. It is also a crazy scramble for technology. It seems that whoever can take the lead in making progress in hard technology can get this attractive fat first. With the development of hardware technology, software can’t fall naturally. All kinds of convenient life applications in social applications are also followed closely. The chat software on the mobile phone even has the trend of replacing the version of computer platform for a time. In such an environment, mobile games are undoubtedly a potential stock, and many game manufacturers began to prepare for the land to be developed. At that time, there was a very interesting phenomenon in the game industry. Many well-known first-line manufacturers could not talk about mobile games, mobile platforms were too low, and could not reflect their hard technology and game concept, but in fact, they could not But already secretly behind the plan.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From disdain to participation, Nintendo has also been labeled as a mobile giant/f9c20980392748929a82fd6613797331.jpg" alt="From disdain to participation, Nintendo has also been labeled as a mobile giant"><br>It is obvious to all that mobile games have the ability to attract money. In view of its huge popularity and extremely fast, portable and networking features, it even gives people the feeling that “it’s a mobile game that makes money”. No matter the large and small manufacturers’ studios all rush in, the whole mobile game market can be described as “a mixture of fish and Dragons”. The most untouched company among many manufacturers is Nintendo of Japan. In the eyes of many players, Nintendo once thought that it could not follow the trend of the times, or was willing to become a stream among many followers. Nintendo’s indifference has aroused various guesses of the players, and various public opinions have begun to take rhythm in the society. However, in fact, it’s all because of the decision-making of a man named Iwata Cong, the president of Nintendo at that time. In his opinion, it doesn’t mean that the company can’t do mobile games. They want to do it at any time, just because Nintendo has always been soft Hardware combined business strategy is one of the core concepts, they will not easily try an unknown field that has never been touched.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From disdain to participation, Nintendo has also been labeled as a mobile giant/867e7820d04445f7aac27c2d0df69c83.jpg" alt="From disdain to participation, Nintendo has also been labeled as a mobile giant"></p>
<p>#I would rather die than follow<br>The price of buyout game works on the mobile platform is usually not high. Most of the products with strong ability to attract money adopt the operation mode of free download of props and charges. Naturally, Nintendo, which has been pursuing the strategy of high-quality products all its life, will not sacrifice its game nature and only make profits through internal purchase. If they do so, it will undoubtedly bring the image of “industry conscience” of Nintendo On the other hand, players of Nintendo games should know that Nintendo’s physical games have always been known as “financial products”, with high price and maintenance rate. In 2017, the first price of “Legend of Zelda: interest in the wilderness” was US $59.99, which is the price of Nintendo’s games all the time, which is about 400 yuan, but in fact, Nintendo’s physical games are famous for their “financial products” The price list of the physical version is the lowest in the sales channels of the domestic network, and it has to start from 500 yuan. Today, more than two years later, the price of the physical version of the game is still floating between 350 and 400, and it can still be equal to many of the first tier 3A productions. No matter in the view of Nintendo or the players, the game is really worth the price. If it is a cheap hand game, it certainly can’t reflect the value of the game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From disdain to participation, Nintendo has also been labeled as a mobile giant/4f9e4e08c25344ea8aecd178b10daedc.jpg" alt="From disdain to participation, Nintendo has also been labeled as a mobile giant"><br>Legend of Zelda: the rest of the wilderness<br>Under the strict control of Iwata Cong, Nintendo didn’t plan to make a mobile game for itself. No matter how much money others drew, they didn’t move. Even some media directly publicized it as a “mobile game resister”. This situation lasted for a few years. In 2015, Iwata Cong died of illness. People will always remember his contribution to the game industry, but ironically, more than a month later, Nintendo’s baokemeng company launched the mobile game “baokemeng Xiaole”. Although Nintendo has no direct jurisdiction over baokemeng, this operation is a bit confusing, as if they have been overstocked for a long time. Since Iwata Cong is no longer there, there are no restrictions on mobile games. The top management of the company will surely see the profitability of mobile games. Now they can do it, but somehow they are Nintendo. Even mobile games need to implement their production concept.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From disdain to participation, Nintendo has also been labeled as a mobile giant/07cf741d309e47f18af50a1645d3bab9.jpg" alt="From disdain to participation, Nintendo has also been labeled as a mobile giant"><br>Baoke dream, Xiaoxiao music<br>     try<br>In March 2016, Nintendo’s first game “miitomo” was launched, and “MII” is a virtual image customization service launched by Nintendo on the Wii platform. These virtual characters can be added to other works as official characters, and this mobile game is also a good restore of this. But it’s not so much a mobile game as a social software. Its playability and content are relatively scarce. Even though many players have gained in the initial stage, they have no choice but to be too sticky. Similar Games will be out of the game in less than two years.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From disdain to participation, Nintendo has also been labeled as a mobile giant/6cd6185fa527403f8e786e43604ea45a.jpg" alt="From disdain to participation, Nintendo has also been labeled as a mobile giant"><br>《Miitomo》<br>But the products that really let Nintendo open up a world in the field of mobile games are not made by itself, but also the fairies’ fairies’ fairies’ fairies’ fairies’ fairies’ fairies’ fairies’ fairies’ fairies’ fairies’ fairies’ dream go launched by baokemeng company. I believe that even those who don’t play the series of fairies’ dream have heard a little about it. Because Nintendo participated in the development of the game, this The credit has to come from Nintendo.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From disdain to participation, Nintendo has also been labeled as a mobile giant/5787dd5dd9f746cba71854d95f8f81c6.jpg" alt="From disdain to participation, Nintendo has also been labeled as a mobile giant"><br>“Fairies can dream of go”<br>Later, Nintendo offered its own top brand “Mario” and developed Super Mario Parkour for it. Although the download volume of this seat at the beginning of the launch was ten times as much as that of “baokemeng go”, the wind rating of the game was not ideal. In the eyes of many old players, this is a very different Mario game from Mario’s. He doesn’t have the consistent sophisticated level design of Mario, and compared with similar products, his difficulty is not low. At the same time, he also adopts the buyout charging mode, which not only offends series fans, but also fails to meet the needs of mobile players. For such an influential game IP, this No doubt it was a failure.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From disdain to participation, Nintendo has also been labeled as a mobile giant/e1c8eea702664e3486814b37505fac2f.jpg" alt="From disdain to participation, Nintendo has also been labeled as a mobile giant"><br>Super Mario Parkour<br>After a period of exploration, Nintendo has gradually understood the operation mode of most popular products on the market. Most of them are RPG plus pumping cards, so Nintendo has launched the same as the social game company Dena, which is also the flame seal of the same heavyweight IP: hero, and then launched the original IP with the famous Japanese hand travel company Cygames. Thanks to the participation and help of experienced people in the industry, the two works have achieved ideal reputation and profits. It is this opportunity that makes Nintendo loosen its IP for the first time. Anyway, Nintendo’s experience in the operation and development of mobile games is almost zero.

<p>#Conclusion: it’s a long way to go<br>So far, Nintendo has launched a total of seven games. In addition to the four above-mentioned games (not included in baokemongo), there are also two derivative works, Mario Kart: tour and Mario doctor: the world, derived from the series of “animal’s son”, which are not officially launched I don’t know how the line works, but at least Nintendo has learned a lot from the production of each game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From disdain to participation, Nintendo has also been labeled as a mobile giant/ea37096d618c4f428409ec835edcea57.jpg" alt="From disdain to participation, Nintendo has also been labeled as a mobile giant"><br>This backward company still has a long way to go in this unfamiliar field, but in view of its reputation and the influence of its IP, it is no exaggeration to call it “mobile game factory”. What’s more regrettable is that Cong Ge, who insisted on not doing mobile games before his death, did not know how he would feel when he saw Nintendo’s style.</p>
