        <p>In this year’s E3 game exhibition and Microsoft’s pre exhibition press conference, Japanese game manufacturer fromSoftware officially released their new work “Elden ring”. It is worth mentioning that the official said that this is an action game developed based on the “soul of darkness” series, with similar playing methods but different systems. But this is not the point. What attracts the players’ attention is that the plot of the game is written by the producer Miyazaki YingGAO, and the world view of the game is designed by George r r r Martin, the author of the famous fantasy novel song of ice and fire. When the “Soul series creator” and the legendary writer join hands, I don’t know how many “spiritualists” will fall into it.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From no one's understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years/ac79eef7da5149a8b3e1f9f5fd7879ec.jpg" alt="From no one&#39;s understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years"><br>Looking back at the past of from software (FS for short), it has been 25 years since the birth of their first work. In these years, they have changed from an unknown second-line manufacturer to a well-known second-line manufacturer. Although their status is not equal to that of other first-line manufacturers, there is no doubt that the “Soul Series” game they made is in the whole The status of the game field is also unshakable, and its design ideas are unique and advanced, which has become the inspiration source of many future game works.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From no one's understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years/0f58a312e1004e3199e271cd6816e9ff.jpg" alt="From no one&#39;s understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years"></p>
<p>#You don’t learn well when you are born<br>In 1994, FS launched their first game, King’s field, and landed on the PS1 console. This is a first person full 3D ARPG playing method similar to the ancient scroll series. We need to know that the early generation of ancient scroll in the same year has not reached the full 3D picture. As one of the early games of PS1, it is a cross era work. There are all kinds of weapons and magic in the game, and the attack methods are different, and you can choose to use accumulation attack according to the situation. The overall gloomy and depressive tone is also similar to the previous DRPG game. If you look at it, the game can be very attractive.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From no one's understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years/c14aabc6cff543bcb8fe1316108d9631.jpg" alt="From no one&#39;s understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years"><br>However, when it’s really played, it’s another feeling: the character’s moving speed is extremely slow, the player’s attack mode has a huge forward swing action, and with the “power slot” setting, he can’t attack at will in the battle. Not only that, the game’s scene is dark and dangerous, and there are many mechanism traps. Most of the time, players are either killed by traps or beaten to death by small monsters, even if the level of the character is far higher than that of the enemy. There are many hidden elements in the game that need to be explored by the players themselves. At the same time, the game can’t be archived at any time, so it’s necessary to find a special archive point. If one lives, it’s useless Please come back, great Xia.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From no one's understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years/ebfedfb595be40b0ad4f509258e4a610.jpg" alt="From no one&#39;s understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years"><br>The strike sense of the game is almost equal to none. You can only judge whether you hit it by the call of the enemy<br>I thought this was a game that could bring adventure and excitement. Unexpectedly, it was a game that people wanted to smash the handle after playing. Is it a game that is so difficult to play to revenge the society? FS’s answer is that all the Games in the market are too thin, lacking both difficulty and depth, and the full name follows the process. What’s the meaning of such games?</p>
<p>#Go the other way<br>In 2004, a programmer from Oracle Japan left the company and sent a letter of application to FS. This man was named Miyazaki YingGAO. He loved reading and video games since he was a child, so that he could achieve his dream in his lifetime. Although he likes reading, he has a congenital mild reading comprehension obstacle. Even a very simple story sometimes can’t be understood. When he comes across a bridge that he can’t understand, he will combine the previous content with the next content, and fill out the picture that he can’t understand by himself. It is with this strong imagination that FS decisively hired Miyazaki YingGAO, who has no experience in game development, and directly let him participate in the development of his own roof beam work Armored Core.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From no one's understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years/e6e3e9dc6f1d4cdc9d94cc03777f0163.jpg" alt="From no one&#39;s understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years"><br>Miyazaki Eita<br>Two years later, Miyazaki YingGAO was placed in the position of supervision of “armor core”. At that time, due to the lack of Sony PS3 console game lineup, a third-party manufacturer was needed to provide fresh blood. Sakai Jian, one of the producers of SCE, found FS. He was a loyal fan of “King’s secret order” series. He hoped that FS could develop an exclusive new work inheriting the characteristics of “King’s secret order”, which happened to be Miyazaki YingGAO I also like the fantasy theme and high difficulty design of the Kingdom secret order very much. The two decided to work together to create this new work.<br>In Miyazaki YingGAO’s imagination, the new work should have the freedom comparable to the American RPG, and the content should be rich enough. The map design ideas and some settings of the king’s secret order need to be preserved, and the difficulty must also be challenging, and the sense of attack must not be as bad as the previous game. Combining these elements, this is Miyazaki YingGAO’s original debut work demon’s sou LS).<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From no one's understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years/54687916fd594b59a5026d1af054d000.jpg" alt="From no one&#39;s understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years"><br>Spirit of the devil can be said to be the representative of going against the current at that time. All kinds of malicious settings create difficulties for players. Killing enemies can obtain “soul”. The “soul” can be used as currency for trading or experience for upgrading. Once the character dies, it will all fall down. Players can pick up “soul” after rebirth, but only half of the players are born after rebirth Life value, and the game world will become more dark. If you die again on the way back to pick up the soul, the soul will disappear, forming a more difficult and more difficult cycle. Such a difficult design makes SCE not optimistic about this work. If not for Sakai’s insistence, the game would not even have a chance to sell.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From no one's understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years/3730ea9c47774eee80b5980238909c1a.jpg" alt="From no one&#39;s understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years"><br>“Corner kill at first sight” is a popular plot in the game<br>Sure enough, after the game was launched in 2009, it only got a low score of 29 (full score of 40) from Japan’s famiton, and most people couldn’t play smoothly and easily. Of course, there are also some people who can be right on Miyazaki YingGAO’s radio waves. They understand from the design of the game that it is not only the role that becomes stronger in the game, but also the growth of the players themselves.<br>The purpose of death is to let players try all kinds of possibilities and cognitive new discoveries. The improvement of difficulty is not only to pile up the enemy’s blood volume, but also to let players explore their own routines and methods. The whole game design revolves around the three concepts of “exploration, challenge and achievement”. From this perspective, the content that stays on the surface will be stripped layer by layer, To understand the fun of the game.<br>The quality of the game is said by word of mouth. At first, 300000 sets were sold in Japan plus the cheap version, while 750000 sets were sold under the momentum of the media in Europe and America. An original IP suddenly reached a million sales volume, which was not expected by Sony or FS itself.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From no one's understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years/76c437da07f741caa27db17b908bddf2.jpg" alt="From no one&#39;s understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years"><br>Ironically, on the 10th anniversary of PS3, famiton named “ghost of the devil” as the best game of Japanese PS3</p>
<h1 id="“spiritual-sequel”"><a href="#“spiritual-sequel”" class="headerlink" title="“spiritual sequel”"></a>“spiritual sequel”</h1><p>No matter how profound the design idea of devil’s soul is, even if the deep meaning of the game is discovered later, the sales volume can also be recovered. In the eyes of Sony SCE, he is still a work of no entry. SCE will hide this IP. Even if FS intends to launch a sequel, it must be approved by Sony first. However, the gold will shine after all. The “B Consortium” of Wandai Nanmeng palace, which helped FS release games in Europe, noticed Sony’s indifference. They decided to cooperate with fs to help FS develop new games. In view of the small fame of devil’s soul and the recognition of the players, Miyazaki YingGAO has gained confidence and firmed his own unique design concept. He has already made plans for the development of the sequel. Since Sony won’t let it continue, we will change our name to be a new IP.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From no one's understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years/2512f01a2b414f4baf13326f906dd3db.jpg" alt="From no one&#39;s understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years"><br>The tone of FS and B consortia is not in line with each other<br>At the 2010 Tokyo video game exhibition, FS released to the outside world the spirit sequel of “devil’s soul” code named “project dark”, which was later the world-renowned “dark souls”. In the next issue, the author will talk about the follow-up development of FS “Soul Series”, including the innovation and evolution of design concepts and ideas in soul of darkness, blood source and wolf.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From no one's understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years/67def0789ecd4119918ebffe148160ce.jpg" alt="From no one&#39;s understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years"><br>From the very beginning, the Japanese game manufacturer from software (FS) was willing to make games with high difficulty. Since a man named Miyazaki YingGAO joined the company, the spirit of the devil, which was jointly developed by FS in Sony, made this “hard core” game mode known to most players, relying on the oral communication between players and the public opinion between the media, so that you can play The play is a fire. In Sony’s view, the game mode is really out of the stream, and there is no plan to develop a sequel. Sony holds the control of IP, so even if FS has the idea of developing a sequel, it must be approved by Sony. At this time, another Japanese manufacturer, Wanda namoko, took a fancy to the pie and decided to help FS launch a new work.</p>
<h1 id="“do-you-want-to-spread-fire-brother-”"><a href="#“do-you-want-to-spread-fire-brother-”" class="headerlink" title="“do you want to spread fire, brother?”"></a>“do you want to spread fire, brother?”</h1><p>For the design of his new work, Miyazaki YingGAO planned that the overall style of play of the game is not different from that of devil’s soul, because it can’t be regarded as the orthodox sequel of devil’s soul, so it can only be used as the spiritual sequel, which means that the game is totally different from the original, neither exactly the same nor too similar, and this game is Dark souls.<br>The biggest drawback of the previous work devil’s soul is that the plot and the world view are very vague, so this needs to be strengthened in black soul, and the system in the game needs to correspond with the plot setting. The world view of the game is also set by magic in the middle ages. In ancient times, the world was ruled by the ancient dragon family, and the whole world was covered with a layer of fog and never saw the sun. After that, there was the “original fire” in the world. Several kings of the world, relying on the power of the “King’s soul” formed by the “original fire”, defeated the ancient dragon and spread the “original fire” to all parts of the world, which dispelled the fog and made the world enter the “fire era”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From no one's understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years/3ee8c371d648429184d1dbe509bf719f.jpg" alt="From no one&#39;s understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years"><br>But in a long time, the power of “original fire” will be exhausted and extinguished, and a curse will appear on the human beings who can survive through “original fire”, and they will become immortal immortal. If the curse is deepened, they will lose humanity and become dead. The protagonist is one of the healthy people who abhor the undead and exile them or imprison them. If the “original fire” is completely extinguished, the world will return to the state once ruled by the ancient dragon. The burning of the fire requires soul. The “King’s soul” of the kings was the best “fuel”. The kings were either comparable to gods or have become monsters, which is not the existence that human beings can defeat. Therefore, the burden of collecting souls is handed to those who have immortal ability Dead people, that is, players are most fond of the “pass fire.”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From no one's understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years/35ec49e9f0714ddea29ffdbc617f1b45.jpg" alt="From no one&#39;s understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years"><br>As mentioned above, “the curse of the immortal is one of the changes in the game”. In the original “spirit of the devil”, the punishment after death is that the player becomes a spirit state, and the maximum life limit is reduced by half. In “black soul”, if the player dies many times, the protagonist will change from a human shape to a “corpse”. In this state, the player cannot use the online assistance system in the game. Compared with The death penalty in devil’s spirit is much looser.<br>For the first time, there are many other settings, even many common elements (archive, online, etc.) are also related to the plot in the game. The new work adopts the semi open world design. Although it sacrifices some interactive elements with the scene, it can also bring rich exploration content to the players, which is the biggest change of the game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From no one's understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years/8662f5a6b30b4a11b5e587ba1d10d024.jpg" alt="From no one&#39;s understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years"><br>In the concept of Miyazaki YingGAO, he wants to create a novel experience for the players through adventure, and the design of the open world can realize this concept higher. Thanks to the design of the semi open world, the game does not provide the route for players to explore, and the strategy sequence of each scene is not fixed, which can be freely arranged by players.<br>In the game, the players should not only face the enemies with different styles, but also be careful when exploring. Whenever they see a campfire (archive point), they will feel very comfortable. The whole world is integrated. On the level of sophistication, even many 3A masterpieces cannot be compared. In this world, the fun of exploration is other Type of game cannot be given.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From no one's understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years/f61499fc34b6402986d055eb5357e87a.jpg" alt="From no one&#39;s understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years"></p>
<h1 id="despicable-stranger"><a href="#despicable-stranger" class="headerlink" title="despicable stranger"></a>despicable stranger</h1><p>Without Sony’s restriction, the black soul was released on the whole platform, and the new work is no longer as unpopular as the devil’s spirit. Even the fami pass, who once scored 29 points for the devil’s spirit, dare not look down on this series this time. With the help of the “B Consortium”, the exposure rate of the downstream plays is guaranteed, and the sales volume is very considerable, even if the transplant level is not good PC version There are also 2 million sales.<br>So far, the Black Soul series has launched three orthodox works, each generation of Miyazaki YingGAO has new thoughts and attempts, making the three works slightly different in experience. Although the black soul 2 is most criticized by players as “some settings are not friendly”, the overall quality of the game is also very excellent. After the DLC of “black soul 3” was launched, it also represented a perfect ending of the series in the form of trilogy.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From no one's understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years/80bb5abcb4294662827ee7c0bd7061d8.jpg" alt="From no one&#39;s understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years"><br>The success of “black soul” made Sony, the former owner of FS, regret, so they found FS again, hoping that they could launch a new exclusive work on their sub era host PS4. At that time, “black soul 3” was not released in the early stage of honest PS4. Miyazaki YingGAO was very satisfied with the powerful function of PS4, so he agreed to this request. He planned to launch an ARPG game with the same hard core as “black soul” on PS4, and this game is “bloodborne”.<br>Different from the magic wind of the Middle Ages in black soul, this time Miyazaki YingGAO moved the background of the story to the Victorian period in the 19th century, and the player will play an exorcist to a city called Yanan for adventure. Just like buying ns for Zelda, many players choose to buy PS4 to experience the game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From no one's understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years/ba29e7047fcf43d590a9bf30789df21a.jpg" alt="From no one&#39;s understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years"><br>The core playing method of blood source is not much different from that of black soul. It’s also a semi open world hardline ARPG, but because it gets rid of the big framework of the middle ages, compared with black soul, which encourages players to use shields to resist attacks, blood source, which encourages players to use guns instead of shields to encourage attacks, and players can also “grab back” their blood volume through attacks in a short time when they are injured. Only these small changes are complete Changed the way the game was played.<br>Handsome fighting action with deformable weapons, coupled with easy to use guns to interrupt the enemy’s attack, if there is no physical value setting, I’m afraid it can not complete the general feeling of “ghost cry”. The simple vocabulary is difficult to show the excellence of blood source. In the minds of many players, blood source is the best work of the whole “soul” series. It has been proved that changing passive defense into active attack can greatly improve the fluency of the game, and also be more favored by the players.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From no one's understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years/a0e65b26bd4641b999973fc024eb08e9.jpg" alt="From no one&#39;s understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years"></p>
<h1 id="no-way-to-survive-no-way-to-die"><a href="#no-way-to-survive-no-way-to-die" class="headerlink" title="no way to survive, no way to die"></a>no way to survive, no way to die</h1><p>The success of “blood source” has given Miyazaki YingGAO a new way of thinking. Therefore, compared with “blood source”, more attention should be paid to the action of “only Wolf: shadow passing twice” was born. The film was released in March this year. The story is set in Japan during the Warring States period. The protagonist is a ninja who uses samurai swords and various Japanese weapons to fight with the enemy.<br>It’s enough to set the protagonist as a Samurai with a samurai sword. Some people use “Japanese black soul” to evaluate the game. In fact, it’s far from so simple: the way of thinking of the game is slightly different from the previous “soul” series. The previous “Errenzhuan” and “Circling” methods are no longer effective in this work. In this work, there is no dodge and no dodge Roll, only with the opponent holding a knife to block or see through the opponent’s attack, who can’t resist first who will die first.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From no one's understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years/e9f3a45515814f43a5c18ee803dc72f6.jpg" alt="From no one&#39;s understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years"><br>Wolf is not so much an ARPG game as an action game. The growth system of characters is relatively weak in plasticity. Only the life value and attack power can grow, but there are many skills of strengthening nature. A new “tolerance hand” which can be used to fly on the eaves and walk on the wall has been added, which is an unthinkable existence in the previous works. Combined with this system that can greatly improve the degree of freedom, although the way of playing the game has also changed, The game specially prepared a set of stealth system for the players, so that they could kill the enemies in an instant without any attention.<br>It is worth mentioning that if players accumulate a certain number of enemies, they can revive in situ once, but whether they choose to revive or not, they will deduct half of their experience and money, or even no loss. It can be said that it is the lowest death penalty under Miyazaki Ying masters. Because of the low punishment, the number of players dying due to impulse will naturally increase Now.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From no one's understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years/1e1cbb0aabab4b198847dac37fd85923.jpg" alt="From no one&#39;s understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years"><br>In general, the rhythm of the game is much faster than before, and there are more means to kill the enemy in seconds, not just simply pile up the enemy’s blood. The fighting styles are various, which can be decided by the players themselves. However, when the game encourages the players to try high-risk and high-yield fighting methods, the players should not forget that the difficulty of the game is still the same. Miyazaki YingGAO is the same Miyazaki YingGAO. The design of posture also shows the sword light between the Japanese samurai in great tension. From the details, the playing method is similar to the “soul” series, but this work is not a purely difficult action game, which contains the connotation that needs to be experienced by the players themselves.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From no one's understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years/5df23e3a15fc4f5aaedc9563fa4c7844.jpg" alt="From no one&#39;s understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years"><br>    concluding remarks<br>25 years later, the “black soul” series has been finished. Sony holds the IP control of “devil’s soul” and “blood source”. It is still unknown whether the sequel can be launched in its lifetime. Wolf is a product based on the “soul” series after radical reform. Although it is excellent, in fact, not many people dare to try.<br>During this period, the style of the game has changed, changed and changed, but the only thing that remains unchanged is the deep meaning that the game wants to express: the game is like life, it’s obviously impossible to pass the Customs for one life, who hasn’t experienced a hardship in his life, and the key is whether the experience learned after experiencing difficulties can provide help for future growth. Players often say that if the “soul” series wants to pass the customs, it must pave its own road with its own corpse. When walking on this road, you will find that strengthening is not only the protagonist in the game, but also the player sitting in front of the screen.</p>
