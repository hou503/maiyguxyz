        <p>It was a normal working day. Peter holly called hundreds of people under his hand to the conference room. All the staff were curious about this. Why did they have a meeting suddenly, and only received the notice one and a half hours before the meeting? Some people hear that the company has a new investor, which may be to announce good news; some people think that the company has a new large-scale plan, which needs to mobilize the majority of people to participate; some people think that the company’s situation is not optimistic, which may be the decision to announce the layoff.<br>In fact, it’s really guessed by this small group of people. The goal of this meeting is really to lay off workers, but it’s not only to lay off so many as ten or twenty. This cut is to lay off 90% of the company’s people, and let all the laid-off people leave the company within 30 minutes, leaving only 25 people to deal with the rest of the aftermath work, all because the company is bankrupt.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How can a good Professional Storytelling game company suddenly go bankrupt/bff152f26e034997af68769d5507c9ec.jpg" alt="How can a good Professional Storytelling game company suddenly go bankrupt"><br>There was no severance payment, insurance expired, hundreds of people lost their jobs at the same time, some were crying on the ground, some were hugging each other and comforting each other, everything came so unprepared, and the subsequent game distribution work was cancelled.<br>This company is called telltale, which is also legendary in the game circle. Like their name, this is a company specialized in “story telling” games. Many IP players are looking forward to a sequel. The sudden collapse of tallale shocked the whole game circle, and everyone was very surprised. How could a good end fail suddenly?</p>
<h1 id="“story-telling-professional”"><a href="#“story-telling-professional”" class="headerlink" title="“story telling professional”"></a>“story telling professional”</h1><p>When it comes to talltalk, we have to talk about adventure games (AVG). In the earliest PC games, there was no image but text, and players could only use instructions to control the characters’ adventures in the game. At that time, only the text adventure games could be equated with PC games.<br>After the progress of computer graphics technology, Japanese AVG and European and American AVG have chosen two different ways, the former is a kind of audio novel mainly based on text and plot, and the player can only make a choice according to the plot; the latter is a kind of decryption game that uses mouse click to collect clues to promote the game. At that time, among the European and American AVG game manufacturers, Lucas arts was one of the best. Its subsidiaries, such as “clever detective breaking through customs”, “Monkey Island little hero”, “Rhapsody of the underworld” and so on, among which “Rhapsody of the underworld” won the annual AVG game at one stroke.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How can a good Professional Storytelling game company suddenly go bankrupt/599e92da771b46ab9f74a0f5cab89cd2.jpg" alt="How can a good Professional Storytelling game company suddenly go bankrupt"><br>The picture of Rhapsody of the underworld is slightly funny, but actually tells a very warm story<br>Many people think of Rhapsody of the underworld as the peak of AVG and the last peak of AVG. Although the quality of the game is excellent, the sales volume is unsatisfactory. Why? At that time, because of the innovation wave of integrity video games, action games became popular, even adventure games were replaced by more enjoyable action adventure games, and the saying “adventure game is dead” began to spread in the market.<br>In 2004, in order to meet the market demand, Lucas art announced the cancellation of its two traditional AVG game sequels, which led to the dissatisfaction of several employees within the company, so they left and set up telltale studio. They are all concerned about making the traditional AVG game come back to the players’ vision, and the primary goal is to first make the sequel of “smart agent breaking through customs” cancelled by Lucas art. They find the original comic writer of this work, and come to the comic IP to make the game. They choose to publish the game in the form of chapters to maintain the game Popularity, this practice continues to this day, and even affects the distribution strategy of many other games.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How can a good Professional Storytelling game company suddenly go bankrupt/75d14429f8c040008a15250f8b365909.jpg" alt="How can a good Professional Storytelling game company suddenly go bankrupt"><br>The cartoon picture of “clever detective breaking through customs 2” is very pleasing<br>For many years since then, talltalk has been making traditional AVG games by scraping the popular IP from all over the world to make a living, such as Jurassic Park, back to the future, or the animation “super invincible leader dog”. It has to be said that these IP are really ancient level, which coincides with the game type of AVG.<br>Most of these games are rated average, sales are average, and the results are fairly good. They know that the audience of these games is not as good as they used to be. They just need to do their job well and don’t expect to achieve much success, so they lower the threshold a little and earn enough money for the company’s employees.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How can a good Professional Storytelling game company suddenly go bankrupt/11d57f91a7b6455aaf6d585b57ce8511.jpg" alt="How can a good Professional Storytelling game company suddenly go bankrupt"><br>“Back to the future” is very good for old fans</p>
<p>#From great joy to great sorrow<br>It wasn’t until 2012 that the comic book “walking dead” adapted from the same name was launched that talltale finally had a prosperous day. Different from the traditional puzzle solving AVG of talltale, the play method of walking dead is more like an interactive movie game. Players often have to face a variety of choices and QTE in the game.<br>Thanks to the strength of the two screenwriters, Sean van naman and Jack Luther King, the plot design of the game is very excellent. With the American play “walking dead” on the air, the game has made great success. This work broke the previous sales record of talltalk, broke the sales volume of millions in one month alone, and won the best game of the year of TGA 2012.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How can a good Professional Storytelling game company suddenly go bankrupt/437047af23c04456a13cf1b5f9c6c79e.jpg" alt="How can a good Professional Storytelling game company suddenly go bankrupt"><br>The success of “walking dead” surprised the whole company. They wanted to continue to copy the success of “walking dead” in their subsequent works, so they began to buy various IPS according to the way of “walking dead”, and completely abandoned the game mode in the AVG game, all of them changed to the same interactive film style as “walking dead”. Maybe this is just It’s the so-called “a pit squatting to death”.<br>Taltale has purchased various IPS successively, and will buy whatever fire he sees. The plots like game of Thrones and Batman and walking dead will only buy from IP. Even the game IPS like land without owner and my world will also be bought. It’s not hard to see that taltaltale is starting to die.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How can a good Professional Storytelling game company suddenly go bankrupt/e9fb40838aeb4c979e90a8ecd15e9094.jpg" alt="How can a good Professional Storytelling game company suddenly go bankrupt"><br>For many players, it’s better to watch others play than to play these games on their own<br>In one year, talltale launched four different IP works, but at this time, the two master writers of the first “walking dead” had left the company’s own door to do “the man watching the fire”. Without the ace screenwriter, such high production means that the quality of the game must be greatly reduced. There are so many games to be played all at once, and they are all different stories. It’s estimated that who will be the playwright will have to be the first one. Therefore, in order to produce the game smoothly, we must make a little “small means”, that is, formula based mass production.<br>As we said before, talltalk’s works are sold in accordance with the chapters, making one chapter and one chapter. Generally, five chapters are a complete season. Although the story of each of the five chapters is different, the structure is basically the same. It feels like playing a game of talltalk is equal to playing all the games of their family. The disadvantages of formulaic games have a long way to go. In the beginning, players may be more willing to pay. Over time, it will make people feel bored and even disgusted with the whole game company.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How can a good Professional Storytelling game company suddenly go bankrupt/b93381c078d04e74820116d055d765ae.jpg" alt="How can a good Professional Storytelling game company suddenly go bankrupt"><br>The plot of “the man watching the fire” is not brilliant, but it is very deep<br>For many years, talltalk has been using a very old game development engine, which has been used from the beginning to the end of the company’s establishment, which has resulted in not only the image quality of the game has not been improved, but also can’t adopt more efficient development methods like the current engine. In order to catch up with the progress, it’s rare to match the completion of the first season of walking dead Not only are there many bugs in the works mentioned and discussed, but also the work of text proofreading is extremely perfunctory. It is not uncommon for the characters with untidy subtitles to cross the wall.<br>The work efficiency is low, and the high-level is rushing to produce new works. One side is going out while the other side is still buying new IPS. In this case, how can we see high-quality works again? Even if the follow-up works of talltalk are not so unattractive, we should know that AVG games are small in nature, so messing with them is definitely not the way to persevere.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How can a good Professional Storytelling game company suddenly go bankrupt/59c42173533d4e36b41163aa6d71cdd9.jpg" alt="How can a good Professional Storytelling game company suddenly go bankrupt"><br>“The legend of the land without owner” is better than the plot. At first, it’s hard to imagine how to change FPs to AVG<br>    concluding remarks<br>The worst result finally happened. The sales volume of talltale’s works was not as good as that of one. Nearly 400 people who were recruited for high production were also waiting for their meals. If they couldn’t make ends meet, the company would go bankrupt. It’s good that talltale wanted to revive AVG game. But after all, so many years, it’s obvious that talltale didn’t have enough experience and could not do a good job Should be aware that they think that one success can be successful again and again. Originally, AVG game did see a little sign of rising again, and finally let itself be personally watered out.<br>It’s impossible to blame the players for not supporting it. After all, there are many players who are still looking forward to the follow-up works and one by one players, all of which are the responsibility of the company. Fortunately, these unemployed people have been accepted by many front-line companies. I hope they can make some different excellent works in the future by their own talents.</p>
