        <p>I vaguely remember that it was an afternoon many years ago. I invited several friends to play games in the Internet bar when I had nothing to do. When I opened the colorful game menu, I made a mistake for “what to play”. On the way to the bar to buy drinks, I happened to see a passer-by playing an action game, which looks like an action shooting game, but the characters in the game can use guns and knives. In a very sci-fi scene, they can walk freely while fighting with the enemy, which looks cool. Just as I was wondering what kind of game it was, I noticed that this friend used the windowed mode to play the game. There were four small words on the window: “star wars a”, so I went back to my seat to find this game. After that, I fell in love with this game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How warframe became the best free game on the earth's surface/fa1f6b9d64c440e0909dfbc4d63a7baf.jpg" alt="How warframe became the best free game on the earth&#39;s surface"><br>The author is half a science fiction fan and half a special shooting fan. Obviously, this game is very appetizing to the author. Although the art style of the game looks strange, I still feel pretty good after I get used to it. I learned warframe from Star Wars A. from national service to PS4 console service, I finally came to PC international service. Although I didn’t witness the birth of this game, I also witnessed the growth and transformation of the game in a period of time. Although the game is relatively small among the domestic players, it is popular in the global market because of its excellent quality, and the number of online players has always been at the top of the list. The reason why this game is so popular is its super high quality, but it’s amazing that such a high-quality game is an online game, but a free game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How warframe became the best free game on the earth's surface/b2c4b3c5dc2940c692503ca0c51b686f.jpg" alt="How warframe became the best free game on the earth&#39;s surface"></p>
<p>#God’s family<br>In 1993, a mini game called “Legends of murder” appeared in a disc magazine called “big blue disk”, which earned young James schmals the first bucket of gold in his life, a full $1200. James is a Canadian who has been interested in game making since high school. The success of the game made him realize that he may be able to make full-time games to make profits. Although he studied mechanical engineering in school, James chose to become a professional game developer. James got to know some game developers through many game works. Through them, he got to know a community dedicated to game developers. There, James got to know Mark Ryan, the co-founder of epic company. With his help, the second game of James, solar winds, was released by epic company.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How warframe became the best free game on the earth's surface/03e6d43de53e4aaea824d0a47bcef388.jpg" alt="How warframe became the best free game on the earth&#39;s surface"><br>Picture of big blue disk on DOS platform<br>From selling $1200 for a game to making $1200 a month for a game, James is more determined. If he can make another game, his monthly income will double. Since the electronic Pinball was a very popular entertainment project at that time, James’ next game was a pinball game, which was named epic pinball in the name of epic.<br>The quality of this game is even higher than James’ own imagination. He just did it and made it. In his opinion, maybe the value of this game is not only $1200, but also 3000 or even 4000, so that he can live a life of extreme luxury. However, the fact was beyond James’ expectation. After the game was released, epic sent James a check of 50000 dollars, which made James enter a new world in a flash, which made him realize that there is a future in the future of playing games, so he used the money to establish digital extremes (DE) studio.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How warframe became the best free game on the earth's surface/c81f4fb30955474fb61eba0078db3054.jpg" alt="How warframe became the best free game on the earth&#39;s surface"><br>Epic pinball game screen</p>
<p>#Ambition<br>After the studio was established, epic hoped that de would continue to launch a sequel to epic pinball, so James recruited some people to take charge of the development of the game, while he ran to study the design of 3D games. When it comes to epic, its most famous work in that year was the series of “the unreal arena”. Many of its works were developed with the participation of de. In view of De’s help to James before, the two companies have started a long-term cooperation relationship. James’s main work is to design weapons and combat mechanism for this 3dfps game. Many weapons in the game have two shooting modes. Because of the addition of this system, the combat mode and operation skills of the game have a different style than usual, making the game playable This system is James’ proudest achievement.<br>De and epic jointly launched several unreal arena, and the specifications and capacity of each generation are constantly expanding. Therefore, the two companies even considered merger for a time, but considering that the super scale of the merger will lead to the increase of tax payment, which will be a large expenditure, so the two companies interrupted the cooperation relationship, just like graduating students Things.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How warframe became the best free game on the earth's surface/2466d2ab126e4e828254b571fd8bf94b.jpg" alt="How warframe became the best free game on the earth&#39;s surface"><br>Unreal arena game screen<br>Don’t know where the inspiration of de after solo flight comes from. They plan to make a game with different styles. In their imagination, this is a 3A game and a sci-fi style MMO online game. In short, they have ambition, but it is difficult to achieve it with their existing conditions. The most fundamental reason is that money is simple and direct. The studio staff created a demo for the dark sector project, and tried to show their ideas to other publishers through the demo, so as to get their approval and fund the project. After several attempts, most developers don’t value the idea of this demo, but the developers behind this demo may be good talents, who can be hired to continue their other games.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How warframe became the best free game on the earth's surface/12d2b26475154014937d6bad0ce32545.jpg" alt="How warframe became the best free game on the earth&#39;s surface"><br>Dark zone demo screen</p>
<p>#It’s hard to start<br>This is a very painful blow to de. their hard work has not been recognized. However, out of the concern for their employees, they have to take this job and become a third-party developer, so that the company can have a stable income. After all, there are so many people waiting to eat in the company, and the company’s surplus grain is really not much. The employees who come to De to work Most of them have their own difficulties, so it’s impossible for De to dismiss them easily. Besides, dismissal also needs to prepare severance pay for them, so they need this job to support the company’s livelihood. This publisher is no one else. It is 2K, a well-known publisher who was just in its infancy. After that, de participated in the development of 2K’s many games, such as pariah, its sequel warpath, and the host version transplantation of 2K’s many well-known works.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How warframe became the best free game on the earth's surface/0b985332086c41b18e5b5e208846ba88.jpg" alt="How warframe became the best free game on the earth&#39;s surface"><br>The transplanting of PS3 version of “biochemist” is in the charge of de<br>As for the “dark zone”, de has always been obsessed with it. While completing the work of publishers, de continues to find ways to sell the idea of this plan. This game combines the efforts and genius of several core members of the studio, but at that time, there seemed to be a consensus in the industry that all games related to science fiction themes would not be popular. Obviously, de hit the muzzle of the gun this time. In order to sell the idea as soon as possible, de had to make a compromise, remove the science fiction settings in the game, and turn into an action shooting game with a style more like the combination of alloy equipment and biochemical crisis. The mode also changed from online game to stand-alone game. As we all know, Canadians are naturally humble, and they can really bear the pain. Although the style of the game runs counter to what they think, they finally sell their ideas, and some people are willing to pay for the game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How warframe became the best free game on the earth's surface/0485f83063134d5f9e5fe4a72d7333c2.jpg" alt="How warframe became the best free game on the earth&#39;s surface"><br>Are you familiar with your eyes?<br>The time has come to 2008. The game called “black zone” has been sold successfully, and it has won the medium-sized sales and reputation in the industry. It’s not hot but it’s still worth watching. In the eyes of De, although the name is the same as the original “dark zone”, it is absolutely different from the original “dark zone”. As a result, De is not willing to end like this. They are still looking forward to one day being able to make the game they originally envisioned, and fully retain their proper posture. Their ambitions have become more ambitious and crazy than they were at first, but what they didn’t expect is that in the end, they have achieved as much as James’ epic Pinball sold 50000 dollars.<br>It seems that they are particularly fond of the word “darkness”. After the creation of “Dark Sector”, digital extremes successively participated in the production of two FPS games of “biochemist 2” and “national defense”, and led the development of 2K’s series of works “darkness 2”, which aims to have a relatively stable income In order to maintain the operation of the studio.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How warframe became the best free game on the earth's surface/2e535500807848e1b0465d196cfdac7a.jpg" alt="How warframe became the best free game on the earth&#39;s surface"><br>Dark 2 game screen<br>However, with the development of time, the development cost of the game is also increasing year by year, and De is not a studio for developing 3A games, so the medium-sized games such as those produced by de are no longer favored by publishers. De wants to develop 3A large-scale games, but it is helpless that the resources at hand are insufficient, but the development of medium-sized games is not necessarily successful. At this time, de has entered a forward and backward stage A dilemma.</p>
<p>#How about a free game?<br>In 2010, a new type of game mode “military games” appeared on the market. The first representative work is the military online game “world of tank” developed by wargaming from Belarus. As a free online game, although it is small in size, it has full playability, and has a good balance between simulation and leisure, so it has achieved quite good results when it was launched. The success of “tank world” attracted the attention of de. at the beginning, they realized that “why can’t we make some small-scale game works with creativity if we have to try to make big or medium-sized games?”? With such a concept, James schmals, the founder of De, and Steve Sinclair, the studio design director, began to investigate the game market, and studied the small but excellent free online games in the market. They realized that their games can also be like these games, and follow-up the game through revenue New, so it can form a good cycle.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How warframe became the best free game on the earth's surface/5a8a20637c7a452883be2b111470a9c1.jpg" alt="How warframe became the best free game on the earth&#39;s surface"><br>Tank world<br>De picks up the design prototype of their ideal “dark zone” again. They hope to show their ideal posture in this new work. This will be a “science fiction + Ninja” style action game. The playing principle is that players can rob the enemy’s space station or spaceship like the star pirates, and the core system is similar to the “land without owner” Shot plus RPG, although it’s a brush game, but it’s more action oriented than the game like “Diablo”, and it’s also more refreshing and smooth to play. In short, this time, they really put all the fun ideas they can think of into a piece of work. Why do they do this? The reason is very simple. They haven’t received any business that can earn money for a long time. With only a little development funds left, James said to the company’s people, “if we can’t make a game and make profits within one year, I’m afraid we’ll really shut down.”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How warframe became the best free game on the earth's surface/8777e974cfe34c17bec2066b8ffba6b6.jpg" alt="How warframe became the best free game on the earth&#39;s surface"><br>Land without owner 2 game screen</p>
<p>#”Lotus”<br>No matter at home or abroad, there is a consensus in the field of online games: there are two types of games, one is science fiction, the other is science fiction, because science fiction is too small. What kind of online game is the most popular now? The answer is e-Competition. After all, it’s fun to fight with people. Different fights with different people can keep players fresh all the time. PVE games not only need to invest more resources, but also have playability. If the update progress can’t keep up with it, the players will lose easily. Compared with PVE with high expenditure and low income, PVP is relatively stable.<br>Obviously, de stepped on two mines at the same time. They made a demo named “Lotus” for the new work like they once publicized “dark zone”, and looked for free game agents everywhere, hoping to get as much money as possible for game development, but basically all companies refused them, because this demo was not only made by science fiction plus PVE, but also by virtual engine , you know this is a free game. If you make the picture so good, the future update quality and frequency will become a burden. What’s more, science fiction PVE, anyone who looks at it will think that the people like de are crazy.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How warframe became the best free game on the earth's surface/11a857ea7878492585137662407215da.jpg" alt="How warframe became the best free game on the earth&#39;s surface"><br>Early game pictures<br>After repeatedly hitting the wall, de has no choice but to bite his teeth and stamp his feet, and they will run the game by themselves. They need to prepare everything from scratch, from servers, community websites, customer service, payment channels and so on. On the other hand, Steve is leading a small number of people in the studio to add more content to the game as much as possible, until the R &amp; D of version 1.0 is completed, which takes only nine months.<br>The final product of this game almost completely uses the concept of “dark zone” in the concept, and the screen performance and visual effect refer to the design concept of the later “dark zone” game. Finally, they named the game “warframe” and took the lead in recording the PC platform. The game adopts the operation mode of free download and charging for props. Players can use cash to buy a kind of special currency called “Platinum” in the game. With this currency, they can buy weapons and armor that other players need to brush continuously. However, the game is not warm and fiery. Although it looks interesting, there are not many people willing to try, so There are still some difficulties to make profits, but the feedback from warframe is undoubtedly more positive.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How warframe became the best free game on the earth's surface/d2f48c591ba547798ff49a12888b68da.jpg" alt="How warframe became the best free game on the earth&#39;s surface"><br>1.0 game screen</p>
<p>#Fair<br>In order to increase the income of the game as soon as possible, de has launched a kind of charging package called “founder package” in the game. To be popular, it is a crowdfunding made by de itself in the game. The founder package contains a set of unique battle armour and weapons for a limited time, as well as a considerable number of “Platinum” and “founder package” contents, so each kind of price Lattice is not the same.<br>Members of the studio are watching the sales volume of the founder’s package every day. The most expensive one is up to $250. What we can’t believe is that players are willing to buy the “founder’s package” at every price, which makes de realize that no matter whether the game is good or bad, at least many people are willing to support this fledgling little game. They are deeply moved. They are grateful to those players who are willing to pay for the founder’s package, and say that these contents will never be in the future Resale. It is worth mentioning that the armour in this suit is called “Excalibur prime (commonly known as” curry P “). It is not only the first set of” prime “armour in the history of the whole game, but also an ancient giant admired by thousands of people.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How warframe became the best free game on the earth's surface/ad81a86dca714447ae5a59b2ad7d6342.jpg" alt="How warframe became the best free game on the earth&#39;s surface"><br>It’s not so handsome, but it’s definitely a symbol of identity<br>Thanks to the “founder package”, de finally got a mouthful of blood returning medicine in the dying state and struggled to get up, but the situation was still different and optimistic. At first, the game was labeled “pay 2 win” because some key props can only be obtained through payment. In the overseas market, this label means that the game is absolutely not worth playing. Almost all players do not like this unfair setting. Since then, de has realized how important “fairness” is in the mind of players, and the props that can only be purchased for payment can also be obtained for free through different channels in the game. It is also from that time on, although the charging intensity of the game is not high, even if krypton gold can play normally, there are many contents that need more time and energy for players It can be obtained, so the player pasted the label of “krypton life”, but fortunately, the quality of these contents is directly proportional to the player’s pay, so the label does not have ironic meaning, and more often, it is just the player playing simply.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How warframe became the best free game on the earth's surface/e0d13b97fd984376b41e5e395b9e728e.jpg" alt="How warframe became the best free game on the earth&#39;s surface"><br>Early key props “orokin reactor” can only be purchased for a fee</p>
<p>#Cycle<br>With the help of the network anchor, the exposure rate of the game is higher and higher, and more and more players enter the game. Therefore, the frequency of de for the game must also be accelerated. As early as de was still seeking sponsorship with the game demo, someone told them that “subsequent updates may become a burden”. However, as a matter of fact, despite the excellent performance of the game’s image, the game’s map uses the mechanism of plate random generation, which not only makes every map different, but also needs to be added if you want to increase the map scale It’s OK to enter more forum materials, so it’s not difficult for De to update. But the difficulty lies in: the game is fair, the players with low base are less willing to pay, so they need more players to have a chance to get higher income, so they find the company that won’t lose 3, valve.<br>Warframe logs in to steam, and the free game itself is a big hot area of steam platform. Such a high-quality work will not catch fire without reason. Under the effect of steam’s huge user base, the number of online games soared to an unprecedented height.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How warframe became the best free game on the earth's surface/67081a4c785f4ea8b3b0deae669e0a2c.jpg" alt="How warframe became the best free game on the earth&#39;s surface"><br>Stream page of warframe, with a high praise rate of 92%<br>Finally, De is out of the state of dying struggle, but at the same time, the game doesn’t leave them time to rest. Since the problem of money is solved, it’s time to focus on the update of the game. Rebecca Ford is not only dubbing the role “Lotus” in warframe, but also the operation director of the game community. Her team always pays attention to the players’ feedback in the forum, where there is a bug, what is the most vocal content, and where there is a dispute that needs to be modified. She has a record of all these contents and hands them over to the development team for processing, while the development team While solving these problems, the team will also consider “what kind of content will be interesting to join”, so as to form a perfect cycle. The update of the game will not worry about no way to start, nor about the source of inspiration. Every once in a while, the team will make a big update for the game, add completely different content experience to the game, and keep the players fresh at all times.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How warframe became the best free game on the earth's surface/836c5de180d44030b2040322cd952f77.jpg" alt="How warframe became the best free game on the earth&#39;s surface"><br>Huge player community</p>
<p>#Status quo<br>Today, the volume of warframe is not the same as it used to be. It integrates action shooting, collection and cultivation, open world, flight strategy and many other contents. This may be the most content you can see in a free game. The picture and optimization of the game are constantly updated and improved, so that it does not lag behind many 3A masterpieces. Warframe’s success today is inseparable from the efforts of every employee of De, from every person who has extended a helping hand to it, from every player who has given support and recognition, and from the company itself.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How warframe became the best free game on the earth's surface/cb610c0bbd2340baad13cc6f3ef54137.jpg" alt="How warframe became the best free game on the earth&#39;s surface"><br>The high-quality game community that de has accumulated over the years may be the wealth that many other games can’t obtain in their lifetime. Warframe’s journey over the years is worthy of learning and respect from many other manufacturers. We hope that in the future, we can have more high-quality games like warframe, rather than using the game as a tool to earn a wave and run.</p>
