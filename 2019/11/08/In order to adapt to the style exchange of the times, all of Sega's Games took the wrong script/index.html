        <p>Towards the end of the year, major game manufacturers began to fight for the game market at the last moment of this year, such as the super fog “dead and stranded”, the world’s first IP “baokemeng: Sword / shield” and the legendary classic “Shamu 3”, which were released one after another under the public’s attention. Even EA also quietly launched “Star Wars Jedi” which became the biggest dark horse in November. Finally, this game All of a sudden, the war became very exciting. In addition to the major works that have been released, many players also pay close attention to those new works that will be released in the near future, such as “cyberpunk 2077” and “Final Fantasy 7re” that countless players are looking forward to.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In order to adapt to the style exchange of the times, all of Sega's Games took the wrong script/84a262c13f22473995562c4aa4a13844.jpg" alt="In order to adapt to the style exchange of the times, all of Sega&#39;s Games took the wrong script"><br>Among many upcoming works, I pay special attention to Sega’s “Cherry Blossom war” series and “dragon like” series, which are about to usher in new works that haven’t been seen for a long time. However, the painting style is not what we were familiar with at that time: the new cherry blossom war changed from strategy game to action game, while “dragon like 7” changed from action game to turn RPG, even “No.1 in the world” ”Jrpg’s “goddess strange news 5” will also launch the derivative “peerless” game “P5s: Ghost pioneer”, which makes people feel funny and wonder if they have taken the wrong script, and the sudden style change also makes people worry about the quality of the game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In order to adapt to the style exchange of the times, all of Sega's Games took the wrong script/566eb39a013e4ffca549f7ce6fb089f5.jpg" alt="In order to adapt to the style exchange of the times, all of Sega&#39;s Games took the wrong script"></p>
<h1 id="“strategy”-to-“action”"><a href="#“strategy”-to-“action”" class="headerlink" title="“strategy” to “action”"></a>“strategy” to “action”</h1><p>For many post-80s and post-90s players, the name “Cherry Blossom battle” will not be unfamiliar in childhood. Many people start to contact the host game from Sega Saturn, and “Cherry Blossom battle” with bright style and rich content is one of the reasons for these players to buy Sega Saturn. The first generation of “Cherry Blossom battle” was born in 1996, and it was the first to log in to the Sega Saturn host. If those who have not been exposed to this series of players look at it now, the “Cherry Blossom battle” series is like a love game of characters with a very clear style of painting and the theme of which is a great style. This is not surprising, after all, “Cherry Blossom war” is indeed a text adventure based game, but in fact, another core of the game is the turn system strategy.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In order to adapt to the style exchange of the times, all of Sega's Games took the wrong script/bcf2a019e4ae40c686ce0cc4365f22c4.jpg" alt="In order to adapt to the style exchange of the times, all of Sega&#39;s Games took the wrong script"><br>Cherry Blossom battle in the early period<br>The game puts time in the “Taizheng period” of the overhead history set by Dazheng. The player plays the main role of the leader of the imperial Chinese attack group. He needs to lead his team members to drive the mecha and fight against the “black nest” organization. What the player has to do is to establish a trust relationship with the members of the imperial Chinese attack group (all women), unite the mentality of the team members and manage the troops The proportion of daily life and character adventure is high, and the character players with high trust can develop a closer love relationship with them. Mecha plus love, this setting can be said to be very offensive to male players. At the same time, the image of several characters in the game is very full and vivid, and has a very high quality game score, making it highly praised when it is launched.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In order to adapt to the style exchange of the times, all of Sega's Games took the wrong script/5450ba3370924736840853c3ae159eb1.jpg" alt="In order to adapt to the style exchange of the times, all of Sega&#39;s Games took the wrong script"><br>People who have played will be impressed by every character in the game<br>However, with the increasingly fierce host war, Sega’s host sales have been losing one after another, and the cherry blossom war, which has always been monopolized by Sega platform, has also been naturally affected. In addition, in order to adapt to the change of the times, the sales volume of Cherry Blossom war 5, which has greatly changed its style, has been bleak, and this series has fallen into silence. It was not until 2016 that Sega held a “hope to revive IP” vote, and “Cherry Blossom war” became the most voted IP. In order to respond to the fans’ expectations, Sega had this “new cherry blossom war”. But what surprised fans was that not only the design of the game, but also the original design of the Royal user, yasuke Fujishima, was changed to the author of the “death” series for a long time, and even the game mode changed from the original turn based strategy to the action game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In order to adapt to the style exchange of the times, all of Sega's Games took the wrong script/90900f64238744a1b1b2cf3ba42badee.jpg" alt="In order to adapt to the style exchange of the times, all of Sega&#39;s Games took the wrong script"><br>New cherry blossom war<br>If the change of human settings is due to the failure of the original painter yasuke Fujishima, the most incomprehensible thing is that the game mode has become act. According to filmmaker onoche, the current number of people who like strategy games is not as good as that of the previous years. In order to gain new fans and revive IP influence, such change is necessary. It makes sense to say so, but one of the biggest problems that Sega ignores: the people that this series needs to meet are the players who expect this series to revive. If we focus on attracting new players, it means that we will abandon our existing “bottom guarantee”. We don’t know whether we can attract new players, but we will offend the old players.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In order to adapt to the style exchange of the times, all of Sega's Games took the wrong script/35cc573445124889bee7d96b2f3a9482.jpg" alt="In order to adapt to the style exchange of the times, all of Sega&#39;s Games took the wrong script"><br>Real combat picture</p>
<h1 id="“action”-to-“RPG”"><a href="#“action”-to-“RPG”" class="headerlink" title="“action” to “RPG”"></a>“action” to “RPG”</h1><p>If we want to say that Sega’s most popular top-notch works now, then the “dragon like” series must be worthy of it. The “dragon like” series has a quite strong local flavor, which is regarded by many players as the spiritual sequel of the “Shamu” series. Few of the series take Japanese Jidao as the theme of the game, which is a game that is thoroughly made for the Japanese to play. So far, the game has launched seven orthodox works and many derivative works, focusing on the protagonist Tong Sheng’s bitter life in the underworld. The game itself is designed in the form of a box court, and the map is not big but has a high density. The game itself is mainly composed of a lively fight and a wonderful story of Jidao. In addition, there are many things that the protagonist can do in his spare time. If the battle and the main line are left behind, it can be regarded as a small game hodgepodge.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In order to adapt to the style exchange of the times, all of Sega's Games took the wrong script/e95883364ca347b0bb677f7f122228e8.jpg" alt="In order to adapt to the style exchange of the times, all of Sega&#39;s Games took the wrong script"><br>Dragon 0<br>The story of Tong Sheng Yima, the dragon of Tangdao, finally came to an end in Rulong 6. Although it didn’t meet the expectations of fans, there was a fair end. Soon after, players received the derivative work eyes of judgment, which belongs to the same universe of shenmuriao, and also achieved good reputation and sales volume. But just as players thought that future works would be around As the eye of judgment continues, Sega unexpectedly publishes Rulong 7. Although a leading role was changed, the overall feeling is still the original flavor. However, in the subsequent promotion, Sega said that the combat mode of this work was changed greatly, and the RPG system of command turn was changed, which caused the players’ dissatisfaction immediately.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In order to adapt to the style exchange of the times, all of Sega's Games took the wrong script/6f01b8dd44574e90a466c0cfb96a0dc6.jpg" alt="In order to adapt to the style exchange of the times, all of Sega&#39;s Games took the wrong script"><br>Combat interface<br>From the introduction, it seems that there are different “professions” for different roles. Some of them act as “soldiers” and some act as “mages”. The way of fighting is also all kinds of funny. It seems that there is a bit of sand carving flavor and some funny. But Rulong always takes hardline action as a major selling point. Although the setting of the command turn system is quite interesting, if it is taken as an outside part Works of a biographical nature may not cause such protests from players. As early as this year’s April Fool’s day, Sega released the news that the new work like a dragon would be a turn RPG. At that time, the players would laugh and laugh as a joke. But unexpectedly, they were serious. For this reason, Sega said that because the new protagonist is no longer a fierce man like Tong Sheng Yima, who can create the Dragon Cave independently, he needs to fight with his partner, and in order to highlight this The best way to set it is RPG.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In order to adapt to the style exchange of the times, all of Sega's Games took the wrong script/3b502a074a7347c6bcf3cb44fcc03c7d.jpg" alt="In order to adapt to the style exchange of the times, all of Sega&#39;s Games took the wrong script"><br>It is said that the command turn system of this work plays “like an action game”<br>    concluding remarks<br>As for “P5” changed to matchless game, in view of the word-of-mouth explosion of “goddess’s strange news 5 Royal edition”, players are increasingly looking forward to the new plot of “P5s”, and the development of the game is in the charge of glory, I believe that glory will also adhere to the concept of “everything can be matchless” and “take it seriously”. On the other hand, vanilla club, a subsidiary of Atlus, a developer of “the strange news of Goddess”, has made a lifetime of 2D horizontal action games (hazy village and dragon crown). Their upcoming “Thirteen machine soldier defense circle” will be their first attempt at text adventure and strategic play, and their feelings will eventually form a closed loop. The four games have exchanged type planning with each other, which really makes them Some people laugh and laugh.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In order to adapt to the style exchange of the times, all of Sega's Games took the wrong script/85ed05d33d2046f8a56dba4f191c8b0c.jpg" alt="In order to adapt to the style exchange of the times, all of Sega&#39;s Games took the wrong script"><br>The continuous operation of Sega really shows that some of the players are numb, which is undoubtedly a very risky move for them, but from another point of view, they may also change the game type in order to be able to have more audience groups for these old IPS, so that these works can have new clusters in the new generation, but simply speaking, The style of “new cherry blossom war” and “dragon 7” has greatly changed, which offended the old players, while “P5s” may only make the players feel a little confused, but the vanilla club has not really sold a game so far, but it has to try a strategy game with a small base. In summary, it is really difficult to give people a sign of “they can succeed”. I hope Shijia really knows what they are doing What kind of attempt, also hope that these works may give players a surprise.</p>
