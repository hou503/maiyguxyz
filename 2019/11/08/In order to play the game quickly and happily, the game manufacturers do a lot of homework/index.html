        <p>How to define a game “not fun”? Maybe it’s the lack of unity in the overall rhythm of the game, or the poor plot and depth of the game, or it’s possible to dissuade from the complex and awkward operation just after contact, or it’s lucky that the game is too hard core and can’t be accepted by most people.<br>The first impression that a game brings to the players is particularly important. If the operation, difficulty or even game system is not satisfactory, then the players will naturally have negative feelings for the game when they haven’t touched the content in the middle and later period, let alone want to keep the players for a long time.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In order to play the game quickly and happily, the game manufacturers do a lot of homework/13a70e641f1f4307a30c1ac000b88f14.jpg" alt="In order to play the game quickly and happily, the game manufacturers do a lot of homework"><br>I believe that the players who first contact with “soul” series are desperate when they see boss, the blood bar that breaks through the sky<br>The author has always held a view that if a game makes people feel uncomfortable to play, then no matter how good the game is, it will not bring pleasure to the players. It is not only the first impression, but also the pleasure and satisfaction for the players under the limited conditions and scope for the single game type. Otherwise, the above situation will also occur. Of course, as game developers, they naturally see these problems more thoroughly than we do, and they are also thinking about how to do it to please the players. In view of the above problems, developers have made great efforts in places we didn’t pay attention to, and when we see these contents alone, they will feel suddenly enlightened.</p>
<h1 id="“bright-and-dark”-guidance"><a href="#“bright-and-dark”-guidance" class="headerlink" title="“bright and dark” guidance"></a>“bright and dark” guidance</h1><p>No matter in what game, novice tutorial is one of the absolutely indispensable elements. Good novice guidance will directly affect the first impression of players. There are more than 100 kinds of games on the market, and there will be different types of novice tutorials. Considering that not all players are cute and new, there are no fewer experienced players. For different groups, the scale of novice tutorials also needs to be taken into consideration.<br>For budding new players, they need to get a lot of information about the game content through the tutorial at the beginning of the game. These content is not just to plug the players directly at the beginning of the game. A large number of words and pictures will only make the players bored. For players with experience in the game, when the basic operation is completely self-evident, these players or Xu only needs deep system guidance. These contents can appear at the right time with the promotion of the game, or they can directly give players the opportunity to experience in the early stage.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In order to play the game quickly and happily, the game manufacturers do a lot of homework/0a9fad668fe64fdbaef45f9c6949d1a9.jpg" alt="In order to play the game quickly and happily, the game manufacturers do a lot of homework"><br>The operation of csgo is only simple to move, jump, squat and shoot, but the deep level operation needs to be explored by itself<br>There is an extreme way, which is to restrict the operation of the players. The full name leads the players. Naturally, the game process can be pushed forward normally, and the problem that the players can’t operate can be avoided. But this feeling is like feeding children to eat, eating is eating, and can’t eat out, so it’s not said that the children won’t eat by themselves until they have finished eating.<br>The same is true of games. This phenomenon often occurs in mobile games and web games. In the first ten minutes of the game, the players basically have no right to choose and control. They can only follow the course step by step. Even the game settings are not allowed to be changed in the middle of the course. When the course is really over, the players’ cognition of the game content is still half understood and cannot be fully remembered. I believe that The players who have been exposed to the game will be more or less repelled by the design.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In order to play the game quickly and happily, the game manufacturers do a lot of homework/3994a165e54d4311aa79ebfad616760c.jpg" alt="In order to play the game quickly and happily, the game manufacturers do a lot of homework"><br>It’s convenient and fast to find the way automatically, but it’s hard to remember the layout of the map once you leave this system<br>Too much guidance of the game will directly affect the game experience, and too much obscurity will make the players feel brainless. It is also necessary to make adjustments in this regard for different game types. So what kind of guidance is effective without affecting the game experience? Take the PS4 exclusive game “mysterious sea area” series as an example. The protagonist seldom has a single activity, usually accompanied by an NPC. In the first chapter of “mysterious sea area 4”, the player should control the young protagonist to follow his brother’s steps and start to take risks. The player can also try the same way on how his brother climbs, jumps, uses props and looks for roads.<br>The so-called “imitation” is a kind of instinct of human beings. It not only gives simple and intuitive guidance to the players, but also connects the development of the plot of the game. “Imitation” means that the players’ ability of “learning” can be exerted involuntarily. It feels like growing up together with the protagonist, and it can also improve the sense of game substitution, which must be said to be a brilliant design.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In order to play the game quickly and happily, the game manufacturers do a lot of homework/955b90a65a4143318cb8b4e713b17bcd.jpg" alt="In order to play the game quickly and happily, the game manufacturers do a lot of homework"><br>The whole chapter is the novice course of the game, the first half is to learn how to operate, the second half is to practice alone<br>There are many ways to guide the game, mostly using psychological and visual cues, such as highlighting an object in the game with a sharp color difference, or warning the player in advance, etc. a good guide needs to predict and simulate the behavior of the player from the beginning of creation, so as to complete the process design of the whole game. There are still many doorways in it, which will not be described here for the moment.</p>
<p>#It doesn’t matter. Just be handsome<br>So after the player has guidance, how to continuously satisfy the player’s “careful thinking” is the added homework to be done. We play action games in order to experience the vigorous fighting, speed games in order to experience the speed of speed, adventure games in order to experience the mysterious and unknown exploration, etc. regardless of the type, players are always pursuing the pure “satisfaction”, stripping out other elements of the game except the core, only strengthening the experience of the core content, then the overall The effect will be improved one level.<br>What does that mean? Do you think that the more you play action games, the more close you are to death, the stronger and more resistant your character will be? Do you feel more and more close to the car in front of you when you play the racing game and you don’t want to win? This is not a psychological illusion, but the intention of developers.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In order to play the game quickly and happily, the game manufacturers do a lot of homework/801ec519d0a84db897f2108dd9342cc2.jpg" alt="In order to play the game quickly and happily, the game manufacturers do a lot of homework"><br>The last few squares of blood will be extra thick, especially in the assassin’s Creed<br>A more intuitive example is the Mario Kart series. The lower ranked players are more likely to get powerful props to give more opportunities to overtake, while the top ranked players can only get some auxiliary props such as banana peel and accelerator.<br>In many other racing games, there is usually a mechanism called “rubber banding”, which is also called “car chasing” in the game. Simply speaking, backward vehicles will inadvertently obtain the performance similar to driving a “rocket hitch”, which makes it easier to catch up with the vehicles ahead. In this way, you can always create a kind of continuous development The illusion of chasing me, which can stimulate the adrenaline of players and improve the experience of racing games.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In order to play the game quickly and happily, the game manufacturers do a lot of homework/088db6f46a324536b2c79a48ee8b7433.jpg" alt="In order to play the game quickly and happily, the game manufacturers do a lot of homework"><br>The “rocket hitch” with the sudden acceleration of the rear car was originally born from the series of “the best flying car”<br>Another example that has to be mentioned is action games and fighting games. In these games, there are many kinds of attacks with different styles, such as Dante’s continuous stabbing in “ghost cry”, “Kratos’s” big windmill “in” ares “, and many characters in” Nintendo star fights “have kicking skills. These skills look like” olaolaolao “ Pull “is gorgeous several times at a time, but in fact, its operation is very simple. It can be easily rubbed out. Maybe the damage of these moves is not high, but players like to use them, because these skills will give people the illusion that” I’ve hit so many times, the damage must be very high “or” I can hit you to fly is I’m more powerful “, which is the illusion In order to achieve endless “pleasure” for the players in the game, let alone whether they play well. If the players feel that they are “really handsome” in the game, they can be encouraged to play all the time.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In order to play the game quickly and happily, the game manufacturers do a lot of homework/7350210b379c464b96d1ab14d1a9ffa9.jpg" alt="In order to play the game quickly and happily, the game manufacturers do a lot of homework"><br>Kuiye’s “big windmill” did not hurt very much, but in the early stage, everyone couldn’t let it go<br>    concluding remarks<br>Making a game is not as simple as we think. Every piece of content we hear and see in the game is actually the effort of developers. From beautiful pictures, moving music and other intuitive elements, we can feel them naturally, and these hidden contents in the dark side are not painstaking design.<br>It’s not hard to make a game, but it’s really hard to make a good game. Sometimes, from the perspective of developers, we can re-examine these games that we have cursory clearance. The content that has not been noticed can highlight the good intentions of developers, which makes people have to worship and respect them.</p>
