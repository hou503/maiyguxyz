        <p>War, which is not a rare subject in the field of games, we can play a cavalry soldier in battlefield, a brave and skillful military driver in thunder of war, or a strategist commander in the division of steel. No matter which, the core is to let players experience the joy of victory in the war Yue. Have you ever thought about how the civilians outside the conflict suffered during the war. They have no military like will and physical strength, and can only watch their hometown and people around them turn into dust in the smoke of gunpowder. No one wants to die in vain. They want to live, so they need to do everything to survive. And this is the story of our war, in which you play the role of civilians.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In the war, not everyone is a fighter, not interesting but can't stop our war/da5c316a5ba54ee5ac6e3a4cfec35e4c.jpg" alt="In the war, not everyone is a fighter, not interesting but can&#39;t stop our war"></p>
<p>#Angle drilling<br>“The war of mine”, also known as “this is my war”, is a horizontal version of survival theme game produced by 11 bit studio, a Polish game developer. Because of its many elements, it is difficult to directly define what kind of game it is. As mentioned above, the background of the game is set in a modern aerial war. Players need to play the role of civilians in the city surrounded by the war, try their best to survive, add facilities, make tools and food, repair loopholes, etc. for the shelter during the day, and do a series of preparations to deal with various situations At night, survivors can be sent out to search for materials and supplies. The highlight of the game is to explore at night. After all, it is impossible for the whole city to have only the survivors under the control of the players, so the players can meet other survivors in other areas. They have good and evil, strong and weak, different camps have different personalities and styles, so there will be different encounters and events. How to deal with these people is up to the players themselves.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In the war, not everyone is a fighter, not interesting but can't stop our war/0eb26eb75d5649c8896672973ae2c9ef.jpg" alt="In the war, not everyone is a fighter, not interesting but can&#39;t stop our war"><br>The core of the game is to maintain the hunger, life and mood of the survivors in our camp, and persist until the end of the war. On the whole, in view of the special theme, the atmosphere of the game is always surrounded by the two emotions of “deep pain” and “Sadness”, so it is difficult for players to have positive emotions when playing this game. Compared with survival, the game is more difficult to “choose”, and these choices often appear in the dilemma of players. For example, if someone in the player’s camp needs medicine due to illness, ignoring it may lead to the death of the survivor. When going out for exploration, it is found that one of the survivors has the medicine that the player needs, but others also need him. Therefore, how to deal with it requires the player to make his own choice, to leave the medicine empty handed, to trade for medicine, or even Can be more extreme to kill survivors to grab supplies. Such moral choices account for almost half of the content of the game. Under the influence of human nature, most players will put themselves into the game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In the war, not everyone is a fighter, not interesting but can't stop our war/e5deb9984de34875ba0881123c675c54.jpg" alt="In the war, not everyone is a fighter, not interesting but can&#39;t stop our war"></p>
<p>#The crime of buying money?<br>The difficulty of survival games always depends on the overall rhythm of the game. In such games as famine and my world, players usually only need two days in the game to meet the basic needs of survival, so as to be ready to experience the following content. In “our war”, players can’t easily relax their vigilance even in the end. There will never be too many materials, and they can hardly survive the war smoothly. In the game, taking days as the unit is regarded as the process progress of the game, and the activity time of players in each day is extremely limited, it seems that they are always in a state of competing against time. In the process of going out to explore, not only the characters do not know the situation of the target area, but also the players themselves do not know. Due to the limited time and portable resources, it is difficult for the players to master the whole area in one exploration, and even to find out what resources and personnel are in the scene. This requires the players to go to the same place for exploration many times, and to master a place All the designs of the area can be explored more efficiently.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In the war, not everyone is a fighter, not interesting but can't stop our war/52fcabc190ca4e678d3617a78ee018b9.jpg" alt="In the war, not everyone is a fighter, not interesting but can&#39;t stop our war"><br>The system setting of the game is far more than that. Although the game itself is not a pseudo real work, it restores the most likely things in reality as much as possible. It is also the case in the above article. Different choices not only test the morality of playing AKI, but also affect the mood of NPC and players. If they do something bad, they will panic and blame themselves. Materials If they are not enough, they will be depressed and so on. These situations will turn the character’s mood into negative, and at the same time affect the character’s value. If the player wants to survive as much as possible, the primary goal is to meet the character’s needs as much as possible. Careful players should not find it hard to find that the characters in the game almost ignore the gain state, and can only make up for the needs of some aspects through the character’s specialty. In most cases, the types and frequency of the reduced benefit state can even subvert the players’ cognition.<br>In short, the overall difficulty of the game and the system design are very inhumane, so the difficulty of starting the game is also on the high side. The dark atmosphere of the game itself, combined with these “unsatisfactory” settings, is very difficult for players to find fun in this game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In the war, not everyone is a fighter, not interesting but can't stop our war/6fd05ba4b87f45dd9ce8f0ffdde1de22.jpg" alt="In the war, not everyone is a fighter, not interesting but can&#39;t stop our war"></p>
<p>#The aftertaste is endless<br>According to 11bit studio, the developer of the game, the inspiration for the creation of this work comes from the longest siege campaign in the history of modern war, the siege of Sarajevo in the civil war of Yugoslavia, which lasted from 1992 to 1996. During this period, the residents of the city were often slaughtered, and tanks and artillery often bombed the city. There are about 5500 civilians in total Unfortunately, he lost his life in the battle. Bit’s idea of creating the game is to reflect on the war. The official said: “it’s time for the game to start exploring important issues like other art forms.”.<br>The author may be able to understand that they want to express their anti war mentality as much as possible. Many unfriendly system designs in the game are the cruel means for developers to express the war. Developers make full use of one of the characteristics of players to pull players into the scene they want to construct, that is human nature. After careful observation, it is not difficult to find that the reason why the players’ camp is set to be multi player in the game is to highlight the concept that “under a disaster, only a concerted effort can overcome the difficulty”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In the war, not everyone is a fighter, not interesting but can't stop our war/26c8ccc691dc44c5acafbabac485cee3.jpg" alt="In the war, not everyone is a fighter, not interesting but can&#39;t stop our war"><br>We can reverse our thinking. Most of the players in the game camp are good people with good hearts. Although it’s easy to be a bad person, it also needs to pay a certain price. If there is good, there is evil. So why don’t there be a few characters with the concept of “I can do anything to survive”? In that way, even if you do something bad, you will not be condemned by your conscience. Players can seize other people’s goods and even kill innocent people carefree to maximize their own interests.<br>It’s undeniable that this is the real situation in reality, but 11 bit, which strives to restore the real situation, fails to make these contents into the game, because if it does, it will be devastating to the atmosphere created by the game, which will undoubtedly reduce the difficulty of the game, so that the players will not feel the cruelty of the war. Bit obviously has a relatively excessive pursuit of the “art” they envision. Although it may cause the player’s antipathy, in their eyes, the artistry of the game needs to be expressed is far greater than the fun of playing the game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In the war, not everyone is a fighter, not interesting but can't stop our war/0a983a16c50b45ec953394989b28bd46.jpg" alt="In the war, not everyone is a fighter, not interesting but can&#39;t stop our war"></p>
<p>#Conclusion<br>There is no doubt that “our war” is a very novel theme and excellent quality game work, but it can’t be called “interesting”. It can bring unprecedented emotion and experience to the players. Although the degree is far less than the impact of real war on people, it has been quite outstanding as a media work.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In the war, not everyone is a fighter, not interesting but can't stop our war/d6ae6fd36d0c4dd399d441396969e8d2.jpg" alt="In the war, not everyone is a fighter, not interesting but can&#39;t stop our war"><br>Many of the bridge sections in the game are hard to forget after playing. For example, the two old people in the mansion, such as the woman who was invaded by the soldiers, and so on. It is precisely because we brought ourselves into the game that these ordinary things in the relevant works usually seem to be very popular. This is a masterpiece that is worth everyone’s experience. In my opinion, it is not a good game, for example, it is a “war survival manual” that can be experienced in real life.</p>
