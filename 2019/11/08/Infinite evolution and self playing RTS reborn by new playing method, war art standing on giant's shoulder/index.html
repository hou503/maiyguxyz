        <p>For science fiction works, I always want to give up, whether it’s movies or games, I like it very much. Although this theme is small in China, it doesn’t affect its own unique charm at all. But there is only one kind of game that makes me feel helpless most, that is, real-time strategy (RTs). Although I like games very much, RTS is like a black hole for me, especially in the face of science fiction RTS, I love and hate it very much, such as StarCraft or halo war. I am curious about his plot, but I am suffering from RTs Hand, if I watch the plot flow online and can’t get the experience that I can only get in the game, this once led me into a contradiction.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Infinite evolution and self playing RTS reborn by new playing method, war art standing on giant's shoulder/3bd056bb55de45faa6b9d4b84bc151e2.jpg" alt="Infinite evolution and self playing RTS reborn by new playing method, war art standing on giant&#39;s shoulder"><br>In 2017, an RTS mobile game named “war Art: red tide” appeared on the market. The logo design is very good, and the painting quality and UI performance are also very good. It is a game made by heart. The evaluation of the game is also good, which is obviously different from a number of domestic gold sucking mobile games. I also paid attention to this game for a while, but it’s a pity that RTS is a cold type after all. Even if we get the best reputation, we can’t withstand the impact of time. Then we can get new life by updating the self-propelled chess mode.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Infinite evolution and self playing RTS reborn by new playing method, war art standing on giant's shoulder/5efdbb984e42463fb2e28885b7259d9e.jpg" alt="Infinite evolution and self playing RTS reborn by new playing method, war art standing on giant&#39;s shoulder"><br>The silence is quiet.<br>As we all know, RTS is definitely not a kind of game that makes people feel like a model for players. Works such as Empire era and command and conquest were very popular in the early years, and then there were two leading figures, StarCraft and Warcraft, which were led by blizzard. At that time, these two series almost looked down upon the existence of all beings. RTS has a relatively high standard both in the game system and in the depth of playing methods. If we put aside the technical problems of the game itself, this type of works will rarely have poor quality. However, with high depth comes the high difficulty and high threshold of the game. In addition to some simulation games on the market, perhaps RTS is the game with the most complex operation and the highest requirement for proficiency. Therefore, the learning threshold of the game is also high. If you want to really master this type, you must invest a lot of time in practice. Usually it’s good to play a single game by yourself. If you compete with other players, the technical gap will be more obvious. And if it’s a duel between experts, you will usually fight very hard, consuming a lot of time and physical strength.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Infinite evolution and self playing RTS reborn by new playing method, war art standing on giant's shoulder/6a8c6ed180f7482bbdeb7174d1225c7b.jpg" alt="Infinite evolution and self playing RTS reborn by new playing method, war art standing on giant&#39;s shoulder"><br>Warcraft III<br>High threshold, difficult to have fun, and may not please the effort, which doomed that although this game type is excellent, there will not be too many players insist on playing, as time goes by, this type has become more and more popular and unpopular. There are a group of people who are deeply in love with RTS and always want to bring this excellent game type back to the vision of the players. They have changed their ways to improve and simplify the original RTS, and they have moved it to a more popular mobile platform, so that they can enjoy the game more easily while retaining the strategy. War Art: red tide is one of them Member. Red tide is not the first RTS game on the mobile platform, but it is undoubtedly one of the best works with the most excellent performance, and it is also a domestic product. All players have to do in the game is to match their own arms, and collect resources in the battle and deploy units for the opposite situation. The rest is handled by AI.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Infinite evolution and self playing RTS reborn by new playing method, war art standing on giant's shoulder/c557a0ee45bd402da76aa9cbda25829a.jpg" alt="Infinite evolution and self playing RTS reborn by new playing method, war art standing on giant&#39;s shoulder"><br>     doubts<br>Red tide has become a hot product in stores as soon as it goes online. In 2017, it was even rated as the best game of the year for national iPad by apple. However, with the popularity of the game, the internal dispute of the game gradually began to appear. All arms units and symbols in the game can be obtained through normal games or krypton gold. Obviously, the latter is more efficient and direct, while the former takes a lot of time, so a new phenomenon appears in the game: the gap between free players and krypton gold players is widened by the paid content, and krypton gold players are more and more happy, and free players are more and more happy Dissatisfaction, there is no motivation to work hard, leading to the loss of players. And those krypton gold players who don’t need money can’t have fun in the game, so they naturally choose to turn to other games. It can be said that the game red is instantaneous, and the cool is instantaneous. I didn’t expect that this time RTS is not cool on the threshold, but cool on the dispute between krypton gold players and free players. The sudden situation makes developers feel helpless for a while.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Infinite evolution and self playing RTS reborn by new playing method, war art standing on giant's shoulder/b355a07adb2d49b993433a7d635eee3f.jpg" alt="Infinite evolution and self playing RTS reborn by new playing method, war art standing on giant&#39;s shoulder"><br>It’s also a coincidence that “Dao TA Zi You Qi” born from “dota2” suddenly became a big hit, which inspired “red tide”: the design of “dota2” originated from “Warcraft 3”, and “Warcraft 3” is also an RTS, which has many similarities in mechanism, and the rules of self playing chess have appeared since “Warcraft 3”, so for “red tide” 》It seems that it’s not difficult to add the same pattern. What needs to be done is to adjust the value of the character. Therefore, red tide decided to add the self-propelled chess rule in its own game. “Red tide” has its own unique advantages. The optimization of its own game is implemented in place. The scale of 100 people on the same screen is not a problem. At the same time, “red tide” has game pictures and materials superior to many hand games. These contents can be used directly, and can directly surpass competitors, and preempt others in the market.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Infinite evolution and self playing RTS reborn by new playing method, war art standing on giant's shoulder/20413f29ecec4f75ba56ac64d6076b59.jpg" alt="Infinite evolution and self playing RTS reborn by new playing method, war art standing on giant&#39;s shoulder"></p>
<p>#Do you forget anything?<br>However, the ideal is plump. Compared with other big and powerful game manufacturers, red tide is still a step slower and a little later. However, it is relying on its unique advantages that it attracts more and even more game players than before. The reputation of red tide itself is still good. No matter what, it also took the work of the annual game at the beginning and has a certain reputation Du, and the return of the self-propelled chess mode has undoubtedly attracted more people’s attention. Soon, the heat of the game ranked back in the top ten. As you can see, the official has stepped up the update frequency of the self-propelled chess mode, constantly optimized the value and mechanism, improved the completion of the mode and made the mode more suitable for the mobile platform, shortened the game duration, and the overall game rhythm more close to the fast pace of the mobile platform. In addition to the internal update, the external game publicity work is not idle. The game related events are held in an endless stream. It can be seen that the game authorities have devoted their efforts to it.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Infinite evolution and self playing RTS reborn by new playing method, war art standing on giant's shoulder/6b910d7d3cb14a8d8c2374658980da2f.jpg" alt="Infinite evolution and self playing RTS reborn by new playing method, war art standing on giant&#39;s shoulder"><br>Red tide’s go chess<br>See here, who remember this is an RTS game? The proportion of self-propelled chess in the game is growing, and the game has been renamed “war Art: infinite evolution”, and almost no introduction of RTS mode has been seen in any publicity content. From the appearance, the game has become a thorough self-propelled chess player game. Fortunately, the official didn’t delete the classic RTS mode, but included it in the leisure mode to reduce the sense of existence. The current classic mode has become a dessert for players in addition to playing the self-propelled chess mode. This is very painful for the remaining old players, which means that they gradually forget their existence, until the official show that they will not stop updating the classic mode, which makes the old players slowly breathe a sigh of relief, but still want to immerse in the enthusiasm of those self-propelled players, and do not know when the next update will be It’s hard to avoid feeling bad.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Infinite evolution and self playing RTS reborn by new playing method, war art standing on giant's shoulder/42944690ae624e49a32dab27ba364ce6.jpg" alt="Infinite evolution and self playing RTS reborn by new playing method, war art standing on giant&#39;s shoulder"><br>    concluding remarks<br>I admit, “infinite evolution” is the mobile self-propelled chess game with the highest comprehensive quality that players can play on the market at present. Later, the introduction of role linkage with SNK also brought many surprises to players. As a player, I can understand that the official decision is to adapt to the masses and maintain the vitality of the game, and many old players of RTS mode have done a good job of being replaced. No one can know what the future of infinite evolution will be, but at least for now, it is certain that the game has the qualification to be remembered by the players.</p>
