        <p>2017 is a year of “fairy fight” for players. Legend of Zelda and Super Mario have finally launched a very powerful orthodox new work after many years. Players are looking forward to the release of “the last guardian” and “Final Fantasy 15” in this year, and the TGA award ceremony in that year was particularly wonderful, In the humble corner, there is also a piece of work that finally ushered in the birth after many years. Its name is “benevolence king”, from glorious tekumo.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun Samurai 3A's masterpiece benevolence king, which is a game made by developers for themselves/ff5205866daf462e8eb51d376a45d3d8.jpg" alt="Is this game fun Samurai 3A&#39;s masterpiece benevolence king, which is a game made by developers for themselves"><br>Compared with the above works, maybe not many people can remember that RenWang was published as early as 14 years ago, but other games sometimes release some news to keep the players’ memory. As for RenWang, it seems that there is no voice since it was published. In any case, it’s lucky that the game can finally be made, but if it doesn’t work, it’s amazing. If it doesn’t work, RenWang will become a black horse of that year. It’s also a hardline ARPG game. In a short period of time, it can become a work almost in line with the series of black soul, which shows that this game seems to be really not to be underestimated.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun Samurai 3A's masterpiece benevolence king, which is a game made by developers for themselves/9df8e0e24c1f4df9ac2a6881cbd9091f.jpg" alt="Is this game fun Samurai 3A&#39;s masterpiece benevolence king, which is a game made by developers for themselves"></p>
<h1 id="inherent-image"><a href="#inherent-image" class="headerlink" title="inherent image"></a>inherent image</h1><p>As we all know, today’s KT is a combination of glory and tekumo, two Japanese game companies. In the early years, glory was devoted to creating all kinds of real historical theme games, such as “Three Kingdoms” and “biography of Taige’s ambition”, which are the love of many old players who like historical themes. Their games not only have extremely close to historical records and settings Ding, and in terms of the performance and restoration of the details, was almost the leader in the industry at that time; while tekumo focused on building action games in the early years, and was known as one of the “three act” games, “Ninja dragon sword biography” and “death or life” were their Golden signboards. For a long time, they have focused on the same style or theme, and these games have gradually become the inherent image of these companies in the view of players. After the merger of the two companies, they are still doing their own. They also realize that this is not the way in the long run, and RenWang has become an opportunity to bring the two companies closer.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun Samurai 3A's masterpiece benevolence king, which is a game made by developers for themselves/984b6fc56bd24b01aac1998a8c509b5b.jpg" alt="Is this game fun Samurai 3A&#39;s masterpiece benevolence king, which is a game made by developers for themselves"><br>Glorious tekumo<br>“Benevolence king” was originally the IP designed for glory. In the original plan, the protagonist of the story has been placed in the Warring States period, and the protagonist has been set as an English Japanese mixed warrior, and the game is defined as “the fantasy RPG of the Warring States period”, but RPG can not make the sense of action and presence like the series of “matchless”. If it is ARPG, it will collide with “matchless Warring States period”. Since There is no need to make another RPG with the same theme in the war, so this IP has been put on hold. After the merger of the company, Guangrong gave this IP to team ninja, who developed the new Ninja dragon sword biography, and team Ninja still couldn’t get out of the framework of the Ninja when he was designing. After all, the style of the two games is too similar. Now team ninja and the Ninja have to do the Ninja 3, so this IP was put on hold again until from software with the “soul” system Listed in the game set off a wave of “suffering” boom, just gave KT new inspiration.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun Samurai 3A's masterpiece benevolence king, which is a game made by developers for themselves/ebff746ca81740deb8bc7a06d81a4aa3.jpg" alt="Is this game fun Samurai 3A&#39;s masterpiece benevolence king, which is a game made by developers for themselves"><br>Originally published “benevolence king”</p>
<h1 id="“black-soul”-“forbearance-dragon”"><a href="#“black-soul”-“forbearance-dragon”" class="headerlink" title="“black soul” + “forbearance dragon”"></a>“black soul” + “forbearance dragon”</h1><p>When RenWang released the real machine demonstration, many players said that they were not optimistic about the game, because any player who has played or seen the soul of darkness would feel that RenWang is completely imitating the mode of black soul, and it is not too much to call it “plagiarism”. However, when the game is officially released, the attitude of the players is totally 180 degrees. The players and the media who have played have been full of praise for it, forming a strong contrast with the previous situation. In terms of the design of the basic system, benevolence king is indeed very similar to black soul. Attack, sprint and dodge all need to consume endurance bars. In addition, the adding point system is also upgraded by adding a point. Using the archive point will refresh the monsters and so on. This is not to be washed. As early as in other places, RenWang did make a taste that only they could make. For example, the fall of equipment is more RPG oriented, more random, and the strong “glorious historical flavor” in the game is also more intense. Although the screen performance of the game is not particularly good, but there is no Jerry in the performance of details.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun Samurai 3A's masterpiece benevolence king, which is a game made by developers for themselves/54779c3aa71447b9a781ff6220730e99.jpg" alt="Is this game fun Samurai 3A&#39;s masterpiece benevolence king, which is a game made by developers for themselves"><br>Scenes and human settings with strong historical flavor<br>The most worthwhile thing to talk about is the combat system of the game. In the past “soul” series of games, the combat system is not too fancy. In addition to some specific weapons, all kinds of actions and moves of the character are very simple and single, and the too fancy moves are far less direct than the ones directly flattening a. In “benevolence king”, the combat system of the game refers to the Japanese Kendo culture to a great extent. Many moves and postures of weapons are designed with reference to the movements in the real Kendo and slightly modified. Any kind of weapon is divided into three postures: upper, middle and lower. The attack power of the upper part is large, the attack power of the lower part is slow, and the attack power of the lower part is opposite, while the middle part is between them 。<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun Samurai 3A's masterpiece benevolence king, which is a game made by developers for themselves/ad250567c9864f7a822817d214837b90.jpg" alt="Is this game fun Samurai 3A&#39;s masterpiece benevolence king, which is a game made by developers for themselves"><br>Lower segment attack<br>When attacking, the character’s moves are more abundant and used, and the skill setting and “Maixin” system are introduced. The so-called “Maixin” is the concept of the actual existence in kendo, which means to guard against the opponent’s heart at all times, which means that we can’t relax until we defeat the enemy completely. After a set of attacks, players can recover their endurance value by triggering the disabled heart at the right time to launch attacks again. In the battle, some enemies will also release a kind of aura called “Changshi”. Standing in it will weaken the players’ endurance recovery ability. Only by triggering the broken heart can the Changshi be removed and the enemy’s endurance recovery be limited. This system is the core of the whole combat system. It seems that the authorities also encourage players to master this system skillfully. After skills are pointed out in the later stage, the above three moves can also be used with the disability system to play a better effect.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun Samurai 3A's masterpiece benevolence king, which is a game made by developers for themselves/e2ebfee58a1d48a0989bd5b2f207853b.jpg" alt="Is this game fun Samurai 3A&#39;s masterpiece benevolence king, which is a game made by developers for themselves"><br>Chang Shi</p>
<h1 id="each-has-its-own-strengths"><a href="#each-has-its-own-strengths" class="headerlink" title="each has its own strengths"></a>each has its own strengths</h1><p>Although team Ninja is responsible for most of the development of the game, glory has also given a lot of help in the development of the game. Later, the setting was changed to a semi real historical theme, and the protagonist was William Adams, the first Englishman who came to Japan. He has a more familiar name, Sanpu press needle, and glory has developed its own advantages in this regard Opportunity: for the depiction and shaping of history related content, each piece of equipment and weapon in the game has its own rigorous settings and details, such as the knife edge is upward when it is used to make a knife, while the Taidao is downward. Each piece of unique props and equipment also has different settings and background stories, which can be described as a good intention to satisfy the details of the party.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun Samurai 3A's masterpiece benevolence king, which is a game made by developers for themselves/8f2c7c635e564f1ab5d0b38df4a78dd6.jpg" alt="Is this game fun Samurai 3A&#39;s masterpiece benevolence king, which is a game made by developers for themselves"><br>The design of the guardian spirit has its own story<br>The design of character action and modeling is tekumo’s specialty. The overall operation feel of the game is very similar to that of “the dragon”. However, due to the different fighting ideas, King Ren is doomed to fail to complete the fast-paced game like “the dragon”. The connection between each action of the character is very natural, and the design level of tekumo, who made his fortune by buying DLC clothes, is also natural. It is needless to say that the equipment worn by the character in the game is rarely ugly or too fantastic. On the other hand, the game’s effects such as weather treatment and scene destruction, which are much larger than that of “black soul”, are also derived from the design idea of “tolerance dragon”. Although the “tolerance dragon” series may be gone, at least it can experience that taste in “benevolence King”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun Samurai 3A's masterpiece benevolence king, which is a game made by developers for themselves/97b2b7e7c9ad4cbc9c03ad6dd7a2c825.jpg" alt="Is this game fun Samurai 3A&#39;s masterpiece benevolence king, which is a game made by developers for themselves"><br>Good equipment and no play<br>    concluding remarks<br>After all, we have to talk about the disadvantages. For example, the map design of the game is relatively compact, the rendering of the environment is relatively simple, and the equipment drop design with strong randomness makes the game more inclined to RPG. Although these defects are relatively obvious, they do not have a great impact on the game experience. For a brand-new IP produced from scratch, we can achieve the same degree of completion as The volume is not easy. Although it borrows the light of its peers to a large extent, it’s good that it has many innovations that are more outstanding. If you like the “soul like” game, you should not miss this work.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun Samurai 3A's masterpiece benevolence king, which is a game made by developers for themselves/a36b9750495044a4bab70f6f5882c8f0.jpg" alt="Is this game fun Samurai 3A&#39;s masterpiece benevolence king, which is a game made by developers for themselves"><br>Although RenWang was a game two years ago, it doesn’t affect that people still mention his excellence when they talk about him today. The first formal cooperation between glory and tekumo is a surprise. RenWang is not only glorious and rigorous, but also bold and unconstrained. After the popularity of “matchless” series and “death or life”, the integrated “RenWang” is also the direction of shaping a new image of the company in the future, changing the inherent image of the two companies. It can be said that I hope that the upcoming “RenWang 2” will have a relatively stable or better performance.</p>
