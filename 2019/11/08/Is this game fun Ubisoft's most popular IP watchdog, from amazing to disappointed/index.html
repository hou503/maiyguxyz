        <p>When I talk about Ubisoft, my mood will become very complicated. On the one hand, there are many IP and works I really like, the most popular Assassin’s Creed series and the military theme “Tom Clancy” series with a large number of loyal fans. On the other hand, the first few years of Ubisoft games can always bring unexpected surprises to the players, like They always have endless ghost ideas, but at the same time, they seem to have the habit of “eating the original”. If a design is successful, it will be put into use in all the Games in their own home. It will not be replaced until the players feel disgusted with it, which also leads to one of the biggest reasons why the company’s wind assessment and game sales are not ideal in recent years.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun Ubisoft's most popular IP watchdog, from amazing to disappointed/20969cc654d04543b7b64f0b8cdbc703.jpg" alt="Is this game fun Ubisoft&#39;s most popular IP watchdog, from amazing to disappointed"><br>There are many good games of Ubisoft, some of which can even be handed down and unforgettable, but there are also many games with poor performance. Some of them may only have the scenery before the sale, but after the sale, they are either ordinary and forgotten, or their quality is worrying and reviled. Among the many “victims” of Ubisoft, watchdog is my favorite but regretful work. It could have been equal to Assassin’s creed, but because of its own mistakes, it has ruined its future, and its value may not have been fully played to this day.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun Ubisoft's most popular IP watchdog, from amazing to disappointed/57f541d4b8f04f25a0e1bb7a71a89594.jpg" alt="Is this game fun Ubisoft&#39;s most popular IP watchdog, from amazing to disappointed"><br>    ideal<br>The watchdog is the only work on the market that combines modern hacker themes with open world action games. Its first generation of works was published in 2012, a year earlier than gta5. At that time, it captured the attention of thousands of players by virtue of a real machine demonstration. At that time, it was the end of the previous generation of home hosts. Both the first party and the third-party developers wanted to maximize the performance of the host at this stage, so as to refresh the players’ cognition in advance before the next era. The answer given by Ubisoft was watchdog. In the demonstration, Chicago is full of darkness and sadness from inside to outside. The environment rendering and light and shadow effect in the scene are up to the level that players have never seen before. The modeling, physics and special effects of the game are amazing. In addition, the setting of modern hacker theme and the handsome protagonist are enough to make every single player feel amazing Next generation games have a general understanding.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun Ubisoft's most popular IP watchdog, from amazing to disappointed/d867e920668c4f0a949b854db3cc4728.jpg" alt="Is this game fun Ubisoft&#39;s most popular IP watchdog, from amazing to disappointed"><br>E3 2012 real machine demonstration, now using mod can easily achieve this picture quality<br>Externally, Ubisoft said that it used most of the company’s resources for the development of this game. It is also the largest and most ambitious work ever created by Ubisoft. In order to polish the game better, Ubisoft jumped tickets again and again, and the players are also increasingly looking forward to the sale of the game. However, when the game really comes to hand, the players find that the actual picture of the game is quite different from that of the demonstration, and there is a significant shrinkage phenomenon. In addition, the frame number of the game will fluctuate in the market whether it is the host or the handheld platform, which means that the optimization of the game is very problematic. As a matter of fact, Ubisoft’s pursuit of image expressiveness makes it possible to use relatively high-performance hardware to perform game development work, thus ignoring the real function of the host hardware. When they realize this, they can only choose to reduce the image expressiveness to adapt to the host. Because of this, watchdog has also gained the reputation of “shrinking dog” 。<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun Ubisoft's most popular IP watchdog, from amazing to disappointed/72042cba1eb845cfbfafda9c1355ab59.jpg" alt="Is this game fun Ubisoft&#39;s most popular IP watchdog, from amazing to disappointed"><br>Comparison between demonstration and actual picture</p>
<p>Back to the game itself, even though the game picture of watchdog is far less than the effect of real machine demonstration, it still has a relatively good expressive force. The whole game takes black and white gray as the main color to render the atmosphere of the game darker, which is also very good in line with the plot and story background of the game. In the game, players play the role of “private law sanctioner” Aidan Pierce, who master hacker skills. Because his family is involved in a series of events and killed innocently, he embarks on the road of revenge. The background of the game is set in the highly technical and networked data age. The whole city needs to rely on electronic systems to operate, while players can use their own hacker skills to the city Most of these electronic devices are operated to fight the enemy. With the combination of environment interaction and third person shooting, plus a little mystery solving and open world exploration, watchdog is more interesting in terms of game playing methods.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun Ubisoft's most popular IP watchdog, from amazing to disappointed/e7e7f9c20d454728991b1ce4901cae6f.jpg" alt="Is this game fun Ubisoft&#39;s most popular IP watchdog, from amazing to disappointed"><br>Control urban facilities for your own use<br>However, due to the unique combat system, there are some deficiencies in the operation layout and system, which will greatly affect the fluency of the battle. In fact, there are not many contents that can be “played” in the whole city. After the clearance of the game, the players have no value to continue to play except for looking for the collection and various challenges on the map. But fortunately, the plot of the game itself adds a lot of color to the process of the game. Many people say that the plot of the game is like a black movie. Although it is dark, it will make people laugh bitterly when it is a farce until the end. The characters of several characters in the leading group are well shaped, at least people can remember who they are after watching it Who? In short, the overall quality of watchdog is still excellent, but because of the shrinking problem, many impression points have been deducted, players have too high expectations for it, and the final result can only be disappointing.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun Ubisoft's most popular IP watchdog, from amazing to disappointed/0db7c8ab85b045e29d8cc1c39c4ea92a.jpg" alt="Is this game fun Ubisoft&#39;s most popular IP watchdog, from amazing to disappointed"><br>The protagonist’s design, from character to shape and even his personal weapon, can only be described as “cool”</p>
<p>#The second generation of “masterpieces”<br>In order to make up for the design problems and optimization problems in the early works, and adhering to the tradition of “two generations of masterpieces”, Ubisoft decided to save them in the sequel. As for the quality of the sequel, the system and game content will be filled and modified. In 2017, “watchdog 2” arrived on schedule. This time, the game really did not shrink, and the content of the game has become extremely rich. The operation design has been simplified and redesigned, which is similar to most of the open world action games in the overall experience. But what many fans can’t accept is that the “painting style” of the game has changed from dark to bright. The map has changed from Chicago to San Francisco. The scenery is much better than that of the previous one, but the atmosphere is quite different from that of the previous one, and the protagonist has changed from the handsome “dog boy” Aidan to the black protagonist Marcus. You should know that in the global game market, black is the protagonist There has always been a series of controversies.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun Ubisoft's most popular IP watchdog, from amazing to disappointed/cb5cbb762843473ea5e0e9ab6148b978.jpg" alt="Is this game fun Ubisoft&#39;s most popular IP watchdog, from amazing to disappointed"><br>Second generation hip hop punk elements are more than the previous works<br>Ubisoft is also trying various AI systems in this work. The NPCs in the game will have different reactions when facing different scenes and experiencing different things. The protagonists controlled by the players themselves can also interact with these NPCs in various ways. As long as you are happy, you can even call the police to name and arrest a NPC. The filling, optimization and repetition of content are not high branch tasks. With beautiful scenery and rich gameplay, the overall quality of the game is much better than that of the previous work. However, while improving these contents, Ubisoft seems to ignore one of the most important things, that is, the plot of the game. Many players who have not been exposed to hacker culture and punk culture may not be able to understand the behavior, aesthetics or even spirit of the characters in the watchdog, but Ubisoft seems to have no scruples about this, many of the plots are not understood, and there is no relatively perfect explanation in the game, which leads to the fact that although the plot of the game is not bad, it does not How many people can watch it.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun Ubisoft's most popular IP watchdog, from amazing to disappointed/b7a81ea8d1a64d21ad3c377b6b5eb2cf.jpg" alt="Is this game fun Ubisoft&#39;s most popular IP watchdog, from amazing to disappointed"><br>The setting of notebook also affects the rhythm<br>    concluding remarks<br>Although there are only two works in the watchdog series up to now, there are some painful points. If the first generation was caused by arrogance, then the second generation’s works demolished the east wall and replaced the west wall, and never built a perfect structure for the game itself. It’s a pity that the watchdog is a unique and interesting play method and setting 。 If the two generations of games are combined to form a complement, maybe the new work in the future will be a good one, but perhaps for Ubisoft, the IP that originally wanted to be the pillar has become the mouse in their hands.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun Ubisoft's most popular IP watchdog, from amazing to disappointed/c75aed8be1c043eb879b005d17694ee5.jpg" alt="Is this game fun Ubisoft&#39;s most popular IP watchdog, from amazing to disappointed"><br>Watchdog: Legion<br>Soon to be released, “watchdog: Legion” to operate any role as a selling point, will undoubtedly sacrifice the depth of the game in the plot, so that each role can not have a full image of the game. This is undoubtedly another experimental attempt. Although Ubisoft blows the cowhide to the sky, for example, each character has its own interpersonal relationship, and what the players do may affect the lives of other NPC’s. However, according to Ubisoft’s current wind rating, it seems that the credibility is not very high. If you don’t pay attention, it may become another big thunder. I hope Ubisoft can realize what they are doing, after all, in the current situation, it seems that the market has not allowed them to fail again.</p>
