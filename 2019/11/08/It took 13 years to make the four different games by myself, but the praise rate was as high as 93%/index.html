        <p>When it comes to the cultural elements in the game, it seems that as long as there is a macro concept, many things can be associated. For example, when it comes to wasteland, it’s easy to think of such representative works as radiation and the land without owners. When it comes to Japan, it’s easy to think of samurai, kendo, cherry blossom and so on. This is what we often call “cultural output”. Nowadays, when we combine cyberpunk, anti Utopia and Bushido, we can get such a refreshing action game as Samurai: zero. If we combine wasteland, punk and Bushido together, what you think you can get is a cool end steam punk heavy metal cutting game, but in fact, what you get is a kind of independence that is not good-looking or good-looking Game Kenshi.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/It took 13 years to make the four different games by myself, but the praise rate was as high as 93%/f7948896610d43ef8ca3dd160dff0bba.jpg" alt="It took 13 years to make the four different games by myself, but the praise rate was as high as 93%"><br>On December 6, 2018, the game ended its long EA stage and finally ushered in the official release. At first, it didn’t cause any sensation, but two months after the release, it ushered in its spring. It ranked in the top ten of steam’s sales volume and obtained the evaluation of “special praise”. The first time I came into contact with this game, I heard from my friends that they didn’t know who was watching the live broadcast of the host, and this game attracted him, not to say how much fun it looked, but he didn’t see what the game was and how it was played for a long time. Although people who have played the game think it’s great, they still can’t think of the right adjectives when they are making Amway to others.</p>
<p>#You are not Qiu Shengwang<br>Kenshi is an English writing method of “swordsman” in Japanese. The game is a collection of sandbox, survival, role-playing (RPG) and real-time strategy (RTs) systems. It is difficult for people to define what kind of game it is. To be specific, the proportion of survival content in the early stage is large, while in the later stage, the proportion of RPG and RTS is large. As mentioned above, this is a game work that combines waste land, punk and Bushido. After combining these seemingly unrelated elements, it forms the strange looking art style in Kenshi. But it’s not against the artistic style. You can see soldiers in Warring States armor are gang members in the desert with a high-tech arm prosthesis There are ronin wearing long clothes and wooden clogs who are holding a Taidao to kill dinosaurs in the ruins , players named this unique style “sword punk”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/It took 13 years to make the four different games by myself, but the praise rate was as high as 93%/2d1f02dccd5a466f8c9462fdede22a74.jpg" alt="It took 13 years to make the four different games by myself, but the praise rate was as high as 93%"><br>The whole art style is familiar, but it becomes strange when put together<br>When you open the steam store page of Kenshi, you are not the chosen one will be limited to a large line of words Players who have played “radiation” series should know that the protagonist of the second generation of the series is called “chosen one” by his people, so he has the nickname of “Qiu Shengwang”. As the hope of the whole race, he went into the wasteland alone to search for Eden’s artifact. His combat power is also very strong (because no one before him passed the test), and he can be ranked in the top three in the whole radiation series.<br>In Kenshi, the author of the game emphasizes this idea all the time. Players are only a very small existence in this world, just like horse riding and killing. Even if players don’t do anything, all kinds of big and small things will happen in this world. Players no longer have the halo of the leading role in the previous game. This time, players play the same role In general, NPC, a passerby in GTA, the world doesn’t revolve around you.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/It took 13 years to make the four different games by myself, but the praise rate was as high as 93%/04fd0783574f4c8ebfe104c3415a7dbc.jpg" alt="It took 13 years to make the four different games by myself, but the praise rate was as high as 93%"><br>There is no absolute way to play the game. According to the developers, players have absolute freedom in the Kenshi world. There is no main line, no plot, no tutorial in the game. Players can do anything you can think of. Borrow one of the official introductions of the game machine: choose to be a tooth sacrifice of businessman, thief, rebel, warlord, adventurer, farmer, slave or cannibal. Players can play a lot of roles in the world. As for how to play, the decision lies in the players.<br>“A string of money at the beginning, all the materials are stolen”. It seems that the developers have deliberately weakened the ability of the protagonist. What can’t be done in the early stage, and a lot of work can’t be done by one person alone, so you need a lot of helpers, a lot of helpers, and how to operate these helpers requires the use of RTS operation mode, but the game UI is several times more complex than RTs It’s “persuading people to quit” and “persuading people to quit”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/It took 13 years to make the four different games by myself, but the praise rate was as high as 93%/fa98231fe14746f8b5086f292b3c9d1f.jpg" alt="It took 13 years to make the four different games by myself, but the praise rate was as high as 93%"><br>Complex and ugly UI accounts for a third of the screen</p>
<h1 id="calm-down"><a href="#calm-down" class="headerlink" title="calm down"></a>calm down</h1><p>It’s possible to see that someone here will surely say: such a game has poor picture, boring playing method, and so hard core system. What’s fun. As I mentioned above, the picture difference of the game, which was called ten years ago, is not too much. Even the 2004 “half life 2” is much better than him.<br>But in fact, the game has been in development since 2006, has been produced for 13 years so far this year, and officially released this year. The developer of the game is Chris hunt. He once said that the development of the game is not plain sailing. He loved the game since he was a child. He witnessed the innovation of the video game for many years. In his opinion, the games he played when he was a child, although they were rough in production, backward in picture and lack in technical strength, provided a lot of activity space for the players. Most of the game content All need to be explored by players themselves. Looking back at the current game, I wish I could teach you how to play the game, and I can only follow the process most of the time, which makes Hunter feel the “sense of bondage”, so Hunter decided to develop a game work he wanted.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/It took 13 years to make the four different games by myself, but the praise rate was as high as 93%/4cb49dfd42b2419d8ea16fda846ef136.jpg" alt="It took 13 years to make the four different games by myself, but the praise rate was as high as 93%"><br>The picture of half life 2 is not out of date<br>Hunter has been working alone for six years. During this period, he almost spent all his savings, so he found a security job to subsidize game development. After all, the food is just right. In 2013, Hunter joined in steam’s “light of favor” plan with his game, and started the “early access” stage. With the help of steam, the game was exposed to the players’ vision, contributing a wave of sales for a while, and the game began to have a stable income.<br>At the same time, Hunter felt that his heart was more than his strength, so he set up Lo fi studio to provide updated content for the game. At that time, there were 12 games entering the EA stage, nine of which had already been officially released, and two were cancelled. Only Kenshi was still slowly testing.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/It took 13 years to make the four different games by myself, but the praise rate was as high as 93%/bb0cabc369cd42c99d14160de4902d04.jpg" alt="It took 13 years to make the four different games by myself, but the praise rate was as high as 93%"><br>“Armed raid3” is one of the 12 games<br>The game hasn’t launched the official version, but it’s constantly updating slowly. What’s more, it’s six years later. If we put it in the past Games, the official version will be completely blown out for such a long time. Because Henry’s interaction with the players’ community has never stopped in these six years, and there is a stable update frequency for Kenshi For players, there is no difference between the less formal version. “You need to be prepared to publish games in Early Access, because people’s tastes are very picky, and every bug will make them very impatient,” Hunter once Tucao in this period of time. Finally, the game officially launched the 1.0 official version at the end of 2018, and added simplified Chinese some time ago. This game finally ushered in his most brilliant moment.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/It took 13 years to make the four different games by myself, but the praise rate was as high as 93%/e13553e018d84f51af9832ef1dd75243.jpg" alt="It took 13 years to make the four different games by myself, but the praise rate was as high as 93%"><br>93% of the game<br>    concluding remarks<br>Nowadays, the screen of video game is always “movie grade picture quality” and “audio visual feast”, and its capacity is also growing by tens of hundreds. Although the screen has been improved, it has been discounted in the content of the game, and there are not many games that can have both screen and playability. When you think about it, Kenshi is a game that was developed more than ten years ago. The picture is roughly understandable, but the so-called game, if it’s just good-looking but not fun, is useless.<br>As for the relationship between gameplay and screen, hunter, the author of Kenshi, once said: “not every successful game has a beautiful screen.
