        <p>Matt walker, the producer of “ghost sob 5”, the last most powerful act game in Pingcheng, said in a media interview that as a developer, he was very willing to develop the sequel of “DMC: Ghost sob”. He thought he would have the opportunity to cooperate with Ninja theory (NT), the original developer, but unfortunately, the plan has not been able to make progress. He hopes to see one A sequel, and this sequel must be made by NT. Without NT, it can’t be called “DMC: Ghost cry”.<br>It can be seen that Capcom’s evaluation of “DMC: Ghost cry” is quite high, even the producers of “ghost cry” series are able to give a very high evaluation, but unfortunately, the NT that developed “DMC: Ghost cry” has been acquired by Microsoft, and the sequel has become another “lifetime” series.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Maybe it's a masterpiece. Is there a parallel universe in the game/2d653ace250e4778a764ecf4c7ba12ef.jpg" alt="Maybe it&#39;s a masterpiece. Is there a parallel universe in the game"><br>As we all know, the game quality of “DMC: Ghost cry” is not so bad as it is actually quite good. As an external work, its most criticized is that all kinds of settings have been directly overthrown. The simplification of the combat system also makes many old fans of the series think that it can not be called “ghost cry”. In fact, in the game circle, there are many other “parallel universe” works based on the well-known game IP, such as “DMC: Ghost cry”. Although the quality of the game itself is not bad, the players may not be able to accept the changes of the original IP, but in fact, as long as these prejudices are put down and the works are tasted carefully, they may also reap unexpected surprises.</p>
<h1 id="not-recognized-“DMC-Ghost-cry”"><a href="#not-recognized-“DMC-Ghost-cry”" class="headerlink" title="not recognized “DMC: Ghost cry”"></a>not recognized “DMC: Ghost cry”</h1><p>Let’s talk about why DMC, the illegitimate child, is criticized by players.<br>As early as after the release of ghost cry 4, the series’s protagonist may have caused a lot of criticism from Dante to Nero, which led Capcom to put the IP on hold for five years. No one thought that five years later, Capcom brought back a “Dante” who no one knew to appear in front of the players: the new Dante looks like a street gangster, the setting of the human devil hybrid has also become a hybrid of angels and demons, the iconic white long hair has also become a black inch head, and the age is similar to the youngest Dante in “sobs 3”.<br>I don’t know what Capcom thinks. If it’s really because of the four generations of protagonists, then why has it changed most of the game’s settings so dramatically?<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Maybe it's a masterpiece. Is there a parallel universe in the game/8ef5ef448f9747a290d63b337b29b1ea.jpg" alt="Maybe it&#39;s a masterpiece. Is there a parallel universe in the game"><br>The first Dante was more like a hooligan and eventually changed<br>So as a series of restart, how about the quality of the game? NT, the developer of DMC, is also a famous act game developer in the industry. It represents the act game Xuantian Shenjian, which has the title of “female version of Zhanshen”.<br>“Xuantian sword” has won a lot of praise by relying on precise and real character movements and pictures, which is also well reflected in “DMC”. The consistency of new Dante’s fighting movements is better than that of the previous one, and the whole is closer to the real human movements. However, in view of the original version of “ghost cry” which takes the sense of attack and battle score as the soul, there is no slack in the new work, although the game The operation should be simpler, but with the seamless switching of various weapons, the depth of continuous moves is still intact, and the overall combat experience is almost the same as the original version.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Maybe it's a masterpiece. Is there a parallel universe in the game/566531808cae4983b3685c2ea77288b1.jpg" alt="Maybe it&#39;s a masterpiece. Is there a parallel universe in the game"><br>Xuantian divine sword with oriental flavor<br>As mentioned above, Capcom himself said that this is a story of “parallel universe” based on the original. The purpose of doing this is that they want to restart the whole series in a different way, but it can be seen from the external reaction that they don’t seem to buy it. What players really want is “ghost cry 5”, which can also be reflected in the reports of various media. At that time, many media simply called “DMC” as “ghost cry 5”, and even many pirated resources after the sale of the game were directly named “ghost cry 5”, which is also proved by the extremely high download volume.<br>Although the media evaluation of the game is very high, the great change of the style leads to the fact that the work is not considerable in the reputation of the players. The sales volume is only more than half of that of “ghost cry 4”. However, as long as the players have played, they will give a similar evaluation: if it is not called “ghost cry”, it is actually a very excellent work.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Maybe it's a masterpiece. Is there a parallel universe in the game/b2f326ce34a84527be7aebec070050cb.jpg" alt="Maybe it&#39;s a masterpiece. Is there a parallel universe in the game"><br>The battle rating of “ghost cry” series features is also reserved</p>
<p>#Birth is the guilty “alloy gear: survival”<br>After Xiaodao Xiufu, the ace producer, left Konami, who could have thought that Konami had produced a new work alloy equipment: survival, the theme of zombie survival, the author, as an old fan of alloy equipment series, could not understand this situation. Don’t ask you to be able to make the game that surpasses the previous one, at least it must be similar. How did you change from tactical espionage game to zombie game? I believe that no one can accept this change. Once this work is published, it can be said that it has gained a lot of scolding. There are not a few people who hold the same view with the author.<br>The first “alloy equipment” game without Xiaodao Xiufu was produced by Jiao youer, the former chief programmer of Xiaodao studio. He has participated in the development of several “MGS” and is a real backbone member beside Xiaodao. It’s Jiao youer who often conflicts with Xiaodao due to his different ideas. When Xiaodao left with most members of the studio, he chose to stay. Maybe he is the most qualified person to take over the series, which makes people feel happy or helpless.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Maybe it's a masterpiece. Is there a parallel universe in the game/68049b6b1c2b4d02b24170960ecc8595.jpg" alt="Maybe it&#39;s a masterpiece. Is there a parallel universe in the game"><br>As early as before the game was released, I was lucky to take my friends to participate in the beta test of the game with the mentality of testing water, but after experiencing the online content of many people in the game, I couldn’t help saying “really fragrant”. The multiplayer mode in the game is basically the trend of shooting corpses at guard points in the traditional zombie game. In the game, players can use various knives, guns, sticks, guns and explosives to fight. At the same time, there is a simple construction system that can set up various walls and mechanisms to resist the attack of zombies, and can use various methods to hang zombies. In general, TPS game adds tower defense, As a zombie game, it is qualified, not only qualified.<br>After the sale, due to the low price, the author chose to buy one. The single player part of the game is a relatively hard core survival game. Players need to explore the open world with the process. In this process, you need to collect resources to make a living, build equipment construction base, and manage peers to resist attacks. In general, the game is very rich in playing methods, The setting of each system also explains the theme of “survival”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Maybe it's a masterpiece. Is there a parallel universe in the game/b8193da9232847a0bdf68540eb7a4f3f.jpg" alt="Maybe it&#39;s a masterpiece. Is there a parallel universe in the game"><br>If you’ve played tower defense game “orcs must die”, the combat system should be able to work quickly<br>Although you will feel that the operation, UI and even material of the game are very similar to his predecessor “phantom pain” (because it is the same engine), but in the actual game process, if you don’t watch the game, you won’t even remember that the game you play is called “alloy equipment”.<br>The plot of the game is based on the parallel universe on the same parallel time line of phantom pain. The opening game itself said, “maybe the story will develop like this, another wild history”. It is clear that this is a piece level external biography game that can not be compared with the one being made. However, from the perspective of gameplay and interest, the game is not as bad as the media said, but it has one One of the same problems with “DMC: Ghost cry” is that he carries the title of “alloy equipment”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Maybe it's a masterpiece. Is there a parallel universe in the game/25a899d41402453dbf792712821f0ce5.jpg" alt="Maybe it&#39;s a masterpiece. Is there a parallel universe in the game"><br>Most of the materials are directly used in the previous work phantom pain<br>This work is a test of water. I think even without komani, the production level of komani is not going to drop. Although this work is still a little short of polish and unsatisfactory in general, it is not the reason why he should be criticized. Undoubtedly, alloy equipment series has been a fan oriented game. Every generation of alloy equipment Four fifths of the sales volume is contributed by the fans of Hideki shimajima. There is no doubt about the talent and charm of Hideki shimajima, but it’s terrible that a game series is regarded as the personal work of Hideki shimajima by the fans. The strength and efforts of the development team and the whole company behind it are completely ignored, which makes people wonder whether they like alloy equipment or small Shimao Xiufu, the most innocent victim of “alloy equipment: survival” born in this lamentable environment.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Maybe it's a masterpiece. Is there a parallel universe in the game/31f55150fb7e4e5a86b53c349a98c088.jpg" alt="Maybe it&#39;s a masterpiece. Is there a parallel universe in the game"><br>Multiplayer part can improve playability again<br>    concluding remarks<br>A lot of times, we can’t help but see that our favorite works are made by developers. Sometimes, they may end up playing bad by developers, but they can’t be changed even better. In the final analysis, the evaluation of a game should be based on the game itself. Bad games naturally need to be sprayed instead. If you don’t like a big deal, you can’t buy or play it. However, many good games are attacked indiscriminately because of many other factors, and even a lot of people who follow the trend are not able to pass. This is not what a player who loves the game should look like. The player who plays the game chart is happy. The game is fun enough. The so-called “lost soul” cloud in the game evaluation has no reference value. After all, no game will bring “salvation” to the player.</p>
