        <p>In recent years, the most controversial game, in addition to Hideki Oshima’s “death stranded”, is Gamefreak’s “Baoke dream: Sword / shield”. Because of the era cutting, the great change of game style and gf’s saying and doing a set, many Baoke dream fans are dissatisfied. No matter how the players criticize GF, how they are not optimistic about the new works of this generation, they will buy them. The feelings of the players it carries are far beyond the comparison of other games.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Once gone, it's hard to return. Video games have become the biggest support for the word-of-mouth of digital baby/005bdfb7b1c04280aa523fc15350894f.jpg" alt="Once gone, it&#39;s hard to return. Video games have become the biggest support for the word-of-mouth of digital baby"><br>But on the other side, it started almost at the same time as Baoke dream, and it is also not so lucky for many post-90s’ memories of “digital baby”. In many people’s eyes, the two works are always in a state where you come and I compete with each other. A “infinite” Butterfly can make many people boil with blood when it rings. It’s true, but in the process of follow-up development, “digital baby” has failed to live up to the expectations of fans. From the beginning, the positioning of the two works is totally different. If “baokemeng” chooses the sustainable development of the whole field, and “digital baby” can be said to focus on one way and finally hit the wall.</p>
<h1 id="“digital-monster”"><a href="#“digital-monster”" class="headerlink" title="“digital monster”"></a>“digital monster”</h1><p>It is believed that most people know the name of “digital baby” through the TV animation launched around 2000, and those who know the IP know that the name of “digital baby” came out with a unique style of “electronic pet” when it was first born. In the early years, the electronic pet toy “Tuoma Gezi” produced by Wandai relied on its lovely image after it was put on the market As well as the extremely high interactivity, it has achieved unexpected success. No matter from the perspective of toy modeling or play mode, Touma Gezi is a toy for girls. In view of the great commercial potential of this toy, Wandai also plans to launch an electronic pet for boys, named “digital monster”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Once gone, it's hard to return. Video games have become the biggest support for the word-of-mouth of digital baby/39f5988ecebe475f82515b114e45f2a0.jpg" alt="Once gone, it&#39;s hard to return. Video games have become the biggest support for the word-of-mouth of digital baby"><br>The first generation of digital monster game machine (the picture is a replica of the 20th anniversary)<br>Until now, the marketing methods of promoting toys through TV animation and peripheral products are still very marketable. Even the animation of baokemeng was originally broadcast to promote the game, and “digital monster” is no exception. In order to promote their own electronic toys, the animation “digital baby big adventure” was launched. With excellent production and deeply rooted plot design, animation has gained quite high evaluation in the global field, and until now, where there is a secondary culture, we can see the relevant secondary creation of “digital baby”. The success of animation also directly promoted the sales volume of “digital monsters”. From 1997 to 2001, the sales volume of “digital monsters” reached 20 million sets.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Once gone, it's hard to return. Video games have become the biggest support for the word-of-mouth of digital baby/54946b124e18405da6ec192015897965.jpg" alt="Once gone, it&#39;s hard to return. Video games have become the biggest support for the word-of-mouth of digital baby"><br>Animation troupe of the early generation<br>    positioning<br>Compared with “Baoke dream”, the setting of “digital baby” is undoubtedly more “cool”, and it is more inclined to teenagers in the plot style. In the animation, several selected children build fetters with their own digital beasts in different worlds and fight against the evil digital beasts. When they fight, they can also improve their combat effectiveness through evolution, and the shape of the digital beasts is also more evolved Higher is more handsome. In fact, the toy orientation of “digital monsters” is to encourage players to cultivate their own digital monsters and fight with other players with digital monsters. Most of the human characters in the animation are almost in the same camp. Although they are different from the toy settings, they retain the core element of “fight” somehow.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Once gone, it's hard to return. Video games have become the biggest support for the word-of-mouth of digital baby/d338069ac89d4ce5856ef21190e59726.jpg" alt="Once gone, it&#39;s hard to return. Video games have become the biggest support for the word-of-mouth of digital baby"><br>There are many styles, but the playing methods are basically the same<br>However, people who have seen this work should be able to feel that the protagonist’s partner in “digital baby” is a “monster”, and each monster has the ability to communicate with the human protagonist, which leads to a more normal relationship between humans and monsters, more like humans driving monsters to fight, if not the plot design, it is difficult to feel the cordiality between the two sides; and “Baoke dream” 》Although it was originally called “the pocket monster”, almost all non-human characters were designed according to the image of animals. First of all, they were more friendly to the people in terms of modeling. However, there would be a gap between the two races that could not be directly communicated. The plot was created on the basis of this gap step by step. Usually, human characters need to accommodate the character of Baoke dream rather than Baoke dream Accommodating human beings, this humble setting makes the plot more sympathetic in performance.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Once gone, it's hard to return. Video games have become the biggest support for the word-of-mouth of digital baby/a83d17b10deb4e19885e0e91fbab5506.jpg" alt="Once gone, it&#39;s hard to return. Video games have become the biggest support for the word-of-mouth of digital baby"><br>What we need to know is that Wan Dai is in charge of toy sales, while Dong Ying is in charge of animation production. They are used to “let the design of animation give way to toys” all the time. How to design animation for toys is how to design. Unlike baokemeng, animation follows the game. The biggest drawback of doing so is that the sales volume of products is directly tied with the production quality of animation. Animation If it’s finished, the toy sales will be finished. Therefore, in order to be able to launch more innovative toys one after another, the animation of “digital baby” began to gradually enrich the world view setting, and even did not care about the previous setting of another world view. Although the courage to do so is commendable, the disadvantage lies in that the animation setting is almost an audience group, and it is difficult for old fans to be retained in the new work, that is, it has appeared since the second generation After each generation, there are new fans to join, and each generation has more old fans out of the hole, so that even though the latest “digital baby tri” makes the leading group of the first movie all return, it still makes the fans have a sense of separation.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Once gone, it's hard to return. Video games have become the biggest support for the word-of-mouth of digital baby/c8a8fef2cfb24c94ae981a74807184d6.jpg" alt="Once gone, it&#39;s hard to return. Video games have become the biggest support for the word-of-mouth of digital baby"><br>Digital baby tri<br>    guarantee<br>Like baokemeng, in addition to promoting toys with animation, Wanda has also launched a series of peripheral products, and the game has not fallen, after all, “digital monster” is essentially a game machine. Different from the game console, the game of “digital baby” is made according to the animation settings. After all, the plot and settings of what kind of electronic pet can be. This is an unexpected phenomenon: if you have not seen the animation, you will not be interested in toys and games. You can see that these peripheral products are basically fans oriented, so it is difficult to guarantee the quality. There are dozens of games of “digital baby” launched so far, all of which are personal computers of handhelds and mobile phones. They can also be divided into large and small branches. The types of these games are from RPG to leisure cultivation.

Video games have become the biggest support for the word-of-mouth of digital baby"><br>PS platform “digital baby world 3”<br>In 2013, Wandai launched a work “big adventure of digital baby” exclusive to PSP platform, which can be said to be the first successful work in the history of the whole game of digital baby, largely due to the plot design of the whole first animation game process, on the other hand, the quality of the game itself is also remarkable, as a pure round system RPG games are also very good to play, there is no serious fan tendency.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Once gone, it's hard to return.

Video games have become the biggest support for the word-of-mouth of digital baby"><br>Digital baby Adventure<br>Two years later, in charge of the production and distribution of the game, the Wanda Nanmeng palace decided to take “digital baby” out of the competitive sub supply market and turn to the adult market and overseas market, and launched the previous sequel “next 0rder -“ of “digital animal world” and “cyberdetective” of “digital baby language”, adopting a tougher and more delicate game painting style, as well as in the characters The design is more fashionable and handsome, and it seems that no matter what type of digital baby series is made, it is always inferior to RPG games with stronger playability and strategy. Therefore, these two games adopt a more conservative RPG game mode, but the former pays attention to cultivation, while the latter is a more traditional hard core. These two works have a good reputation in the RPG field, but the sales volume may not be very ideal. After all, the old fans have been consumed by the animation of this IP, and these games have become the only support on the reputation of “digital baby”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Once gone, it's hard to return.

Video games have become the biggest support for the word-of-mouth of digital baby"><br>Digital baby: desperate for survival<br>The timely transformation after experiencing the storm is to keep the bottom line of “digital baby”. In short, the most emotional crowd for this series is the fans of the first animation. Now these people have grown up and are no longer interested in the works of zigongxiang. Later, these better works are oriented to these people, after all, almost Each generation has its own fans. It’s hard for all fans to satisfy whether it’s animation or games. It’s better to give priority to the group with the largest base. Although this can keep pace at present, it is doomed not to go too far. At present, the community environment of “digital baby” is gradually getting better. I hope that “digital baby” can find a new breakthrough in the near future.</p>
