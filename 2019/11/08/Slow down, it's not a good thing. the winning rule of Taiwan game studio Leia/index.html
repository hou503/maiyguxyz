        <p>Music game has a game circle that is neither big nor small. People who like it will be trapped in it, and people who don’t like it will absolutely despise it. The playing method of music games is usually not complicated, and the difficulty of development is not too high. Most music games are mainly based on strike. Therefore, it is only necessary to have enough excellent music lineup and make excellent and reasonable music score to form a music game with not low quality.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Slow down, it's not a good thing. the winning rule of Taiwan game studio Leia/c88c893ba3514daaa07a04808053375e.jpg" alt="Slow down, it&#39;s not a good thing. the winning rule of Taiwan game studio Leia"><br>When it comes to music games, mainstream players may mention such world-renowned works as “the future of the first sound: the singer’s plan” or “taiguda Ren”. If it is put in the domestic market, it will mention the same name: Leia. This studio from Taiwan started by developing music games on mobile platforms. With its unique game style and excellent production quality, it enjoys a high reputation throughout China. After trying to make other kinds of works, they have also achieved good reputation. Now they will bring a new work, which is another attempt and challenge for the new type.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Slow down, it's not a good thing. the winning rule of Taiwan game studio Leia/73692cba8b534d6592d7f8597faba1e2.jpg" alt="Slow down, it&#39;s not a good thing. the winning rule of Taiwan game studio Leia"></p>
<h1 id="“omnivorous”-people-and-“omnivorous”-companies"><a href="#“omnivorous”-people-and-“omnivorous”-companies" class="headerlink" title="“omnivorous” people and “omnivorous” companies"></a>“omnivorous” people and “omnivorous” companies</h1><p>One of the founders and CEO of Leia company is youmingyang, who has been in touch with video games since he was very young. Youmingyang’s father is a programmer, so his family has been equipped with a computer for a long time. At that time, when the Apple II home computer was famous in the digital field in the 1980s, it was thanks to this condition that youmingyang’s Enlightenment tour The platform is Apple II.<br>At that time, most of the Games were from overseas markets. Neither Taiwan nor the mainland had a few works that could be carried on the table. Therefore, if you want to play games on a PC, you can only buy floppy disks or disks handed down from overseas, and there is no Chinese. If you know English well, you can only guess by yourself if you can’t speak English. For a Taiwanese boy who is only four or five years old, it’s like talking to foreigners on a zero basis if he wants to play a game that is almost full of text in his early years. But you Mingyang still relies on himself to guess and figure out how to play one game after another. It’s in this situation that he comes up with the idea of playing a game in the future.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Slow down, it's not a good thing. the winning rule of Taiwan game studio Leia/e16ae4d713844d82b1eb46894b129041.jpg" alt="Slow down, it&#39;s not a good thing. the winning rule of Taiwan game studio Leia"><br>Small and simple Apple II is favored by enterprises<br>In addition to playing games, you Mingyang still likes music. In primary school, he studied piano like other children. Before junior high school, he liked classical guitar, so he practiced until university. To be sure, these two are his biggest hobbies. In his spare time, he also likes to see anime, read novels, and dabble in various types.<br>It is precisely because of his experience in various fields that he directly led to his positioning in the founding of Raya: including but not limited to music games, taking his most familiar field as the company’s business core, and other types of games can choose to try after accumulating experience. In fact, before youmingyang started the company with his small partners, they had done some arcade projects for a period of time, and the effect was not very ideal. But at least they learned the experience of entrepreneurship, just as smart phones began to enter the growth period, they also decided to do mobile games with this momentum, but they didn’t want to do the same games as other manufacturers.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Slow down, it's not a good thing. the winning rule of Taiwan game studio Leia/49dbbaba314c490c9afa4c30139559dc.jpg" alt="Slow down, it&#39;s not a good thing. the winning rule of Taiwan game studio Leia"><br>Photo of core members, Zuo Yi is famous for you</p>
<p>#Art and technology<br>At the beginning of rayark company’s establishment, the company set up four works, including two music games, one action game and one leisure game. Their first work is one of the two music games. Rayar named it “cytus”, which is still the most popular video game works on mobile platform. The style of cytus is similar to that of DJ Max technika, but it’s a special layout design for the particularity of mobile platform. Cytus is not as hot and dry as other music games. At first glance, the slow interface animation and the cold color matching of the whole sci-fi wind are not even a music game.<br>As mentioned at the beginning of the article, music game is a kind of category that says “the small is not the small, the public is not the public”, and the choice of this type of game is obviously not suitable for a just started game studio, and the famous of this game once explained that the reason why they choose to do music game is that they are relatively familiar with the field on the one hand, and then when they do the arcade business before I’ve had experience. Although the audio games are relatively small, the user group is usually loyal and stable. If we do well, it will soon spread in this not too large circle.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Slow down, it's not a good thing. the winning rule of Taiwan game studio Leia/4d02e3c28931438183ee50bbb83f9d76.jpg" alt="Slow down, it&#39;s not a good thing. the winning rule of Taiwan game studio Leia"><br>“Cytus”<br>It’s one of Leia’s business strategies to not rush for success and have a long-term vision. However, cytus exceeded their expectations and soon became the top of the hot sales list in various countries. It seems that they despised the mobile game, a market with a huge user base. With their unique style and excellent production, they even attracted many players who didn’t play video games, The scope of this field has been expanded.<br>Cytus is good at controlling the difficulty. Leisure players can enjoy the game, and core players can also get challenges in high difficulty. The subsequent release of “deemo” is based on the original design of a more people-friendly drop-down audio game. It tells a warm and moving story with the piano as the blueprint of the game. It is a very rare thing to add a plot in the music game, but the plot of “deemo” is definitely a bonus of the game, and this work reveals a sense of literature and art from the core, As a result, many players have entered Leia’s pit from this generation’s works. Deemo is also the most famous one of Leia’s works.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Slow down, it's not a good thing. the winning rule of Taiwan game studio Leia/eafdbea347e043059021e2c51b91f0f7.jpg" alt="Slow down, it&#39;s not a good thing. the winning rule of Taiwan game studio Leia"><br>“Deemo”<br>     balance<br>Later, Leia once launched the leisure game “Mandala”, science fiction action game “implosion explosion”, youth theme music game “voez lankong”, Mandala “is a completely free leisure game,” implosion explosion “is to pay for the purchase of the game body buy-out system, while” voez lankong “is to use the single buy-out system, each time trying to Different charging modes try to find out the mode that can satisfy the players and generate income. In the view of you Mingyang, the success of a game in the industry depends on three standards: enough players, enough income, and whether the game is fun or not. It is not easy to meet these three conditions at the same time. The game that can earn money is not necessarily fun, and the game that the players value highly is not necessarily able to earn money. So he decided to plan his own products for two different routes, one is to buy them out, the other is to buy them for free, and the work born under the planning of the latter is their first RPG game “Vientiane”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Slow down, it's not a good thing. the winning rule of Taiwan game studio Leia/6c802f90e5be44f0964e8699fadfbb72.jpg" alt="Slow down, it&#39;s not a good thing. the winning rule of Taiwan game studio Leia"><br>Implosion explosion<br>“Vientiane tale” is Leia’s first work operated in F2P mode, but it doesn’t mean that they can cut corners, whether it’s picture, special effect, plot or sound effect, it still maintains Leia’s consistent high standard, and a card like RPG game, “Vientiane tale” is not like other similar hand games, but only plays a side ball, Without physical strength, combat power and other settings, the game focuses on the plot shaping, and the playing method also tends to experience the plot and collect characters. Without too complex content, there are fewer pay points for games.<br>This approach is effective. In just one month, it has generated 100 million yuan of revenue for Leia, more than the revenue of all their previous single games. But as a work almost no different from single game, if there is no rich game content to support, the later content of the game will become boring, and these are not the main problems for Leia, their core is always kept in the plot and role content filling, because they do not want to stick the players to their games, just through the Capacity update to extend the vitality, if like other manufacturers as pure for money, then they would rather not do this game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Slow down, it's not a good thing. the winning rule of Taiwan game studio Leia/0ff183f4a64d448993f135390c8521b2.jpg" alt="Slow down, it&#39;s not a good thing. the winning rule of Taiwan game studio Leia"><br>The story of Vientiane<br>    concluding remarks<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Slow down, it's not a good thing. the winning rule of Taiwan game studio Leia/eb63047e4c3247d084f569f9b1e24ad7.jpg" alt="Slow down, it&#39;s not a good thing. the winning rule of Taiwan game studio Leia"><br>Mo: astray cell lost<br>To be fair, reya is really a rare game company in the market that focuses on the development of high-quality games, but also has a very conscientious operation. They can get their own place in today’s highly competitive market only by their original intention. This spirit is worth learning from the game manufacturers in our mainland. Today’s Leia is not only a game studio, but also an agent. The horizontal action game Mo: astray cell lost, which Leia first launched in cooperation with the third-party independent game studio, is about to be released on the PC side. I believe that with Leia’s reputation, this time it can still become a phenomenal pop-up work. Before that, each of their games Almost all of them can be called “hot money”.</p>
