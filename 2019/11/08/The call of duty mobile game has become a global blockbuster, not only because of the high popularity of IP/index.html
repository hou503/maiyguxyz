        <p>Nowadays, the performance of smart phones is always improving, so the production scale of mobile games is gradually becoming large. On the portability and popularity, it has been far away from the handheld, and has become a major mainstream platform that can not be ignored. With more and more first-line game manufacturers joining in, the luxury of mobile game lineup is not the same now. It is no longer a dream to bring famous 3A works and IP to mobile platform. The ability of mobile games to attract gold is obvious to all, and anyone wants to take a share in this “gold mine”. However, the players of mobile games play much more, and their vision and taste are becoming increasingly critical. If the quality of the game is not up to standard or the taste is ugly, they will soon be forgotten by people in such a fierce market.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The call of duty mobile game has become a global blockbuster, not only because of the high popularity of IP/dbe92e4ce5494781bc3fa3258e843558.jpg" alt="The call of duty mobile game has become a global blockbuster, not only because of the high popularity of IP"><br>Some time ago, the most topical and hot topic in the mobile game market was “eating chicken” escape. Every manufacturer spared no effort to seize the market. Today, looking at the global market, the most popular overseas is still the night of Fortress, which is dominated by PC and mobile phones, while in the domestic market, only the completely rectified “peace elite” (the former Jedi survival: stimulate the battlefield) has become the final winner. Looking back to the internal competition between Tencent’s Tianmei studio and photon studio, it seems that from the very beginning, Tianmei studio ‘ We will complete the counter attack with a new flag, and this “big killer” is the world famous FPS game “call of duty” authorized by Activision.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The call of duty mobile game has become a global blockbuster, not only because of the high popularity of IP/e2da7725af6845acbd9d52954b042a5e.jpg" alt="The call of duty mobile game has become a global blockbuster, not only because of the high popularity of IP"><br>    gambling<br>There are not many successful cases for overseas game companies to give IP to Chinese game manufacturers as agents, but almost every successful product has excellent quality and good reputation. Otherwise, it is because of its very innovative design and content, such as final fantasy 14 of Shengqu agent, Blizzard games of Netease agent, which have made great achievements 。 However, the popularity of call of duty does not need the author’s introduction. As a new year’s game, it can achieve sales of tens of millions of levels in the global market every year. This data is really scary. This is not the first time Tencent has launched a cooperation on “call of duty” with Activision. As early as 2012, Tencent joined hands with Activision to launch “call of duty ol” for Chinese players only. Many foreign players have seen it very well. This work is authorized by Activision, developed by raven studio of Activision, and planned and operated by Tencent. At first, this work was a FPS online game of good quality. However, with more and more krypton content added, it affected the balance and profiteering of the operation mode, and the reputation of the game continued to decline. Now, the call of duty ol has become the least despised by fans and passers-by players Gu’s call of duty.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The call of duty mobile game has become a global blockbuster, not only because of the high popularity of IP/b20b0246bb3f47ee9d51d7b236af46c3.jpg" alt="The call of duty mobile game has become a global blockbuster, not only because of the high popularity of IP"><br>It is undoubtedly a gamble with great risk to hand over the most valuable business IP to another company’s agent. Call of duty’s first attempt to enter the Chinese market ended in failure. Since the beginning of mobile games, there have been rumors of “call of duty” coming out of mobile games. Until the end of last year, the “call of duty” mobile game produced by Tencent as agent of Tianmei finally appeared in the field of vision of players. It began to pre register on the day of announcement, and then obtained tens of millions of appointments in the global market in a very short time Quantity. But unfortunately, as a game developed by Chinese people, it started to open appointments to Chinese players two months after the global opening of appointments, and now this game has taken the lead in the overseas market online operation, while Guofu has only launched several limited time tests, the biggest reason is that the version number has not been released, until today there is still no news.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The call of duty mobile game has become a global blockbuster, not only because of the high popularity of IP/458c869a50d74360a537a3a4d08aef90.jpg" alt="The call of duty mobile game has become a global blockbuster, not only because of the high popularity of IP"><br>    misunderstanding<br>Some people may not believe that, just a week after its launch, the international service has achieved over 100 million downloads, far more than any of the previous big escape game overseas players praised it, claiming that the original has a high degree of restoration, and has the flavor of “call of duty” online battle in the fighting style. After seeing that the game has made such outstanding achievements, rob kostiqi, President of Activision, also gave a high appraisal to Tencent, which is responsible for the development and operation of the game, and said that it is a “very great game”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The call of duty mobile game has become a global blockbuster, not only because of the high popularity of IP/11dfb0b2908349659a36dddba2b5805e.jpg" alt="The call of duty mobile game has become a global blockbuster, not only because of the high popularity of IP"><br>This work has designed a completely user-defined operation mode for the fast-paced street battle in the call of duty, which makes the operation very simple and comfortable, and includes team competition, occupying points, blasting and many other highly praised modes. Many classic maps that are enjoyed by old players are also used, and popular characters of all generations are added to the game, so to speak This work has a high degree of completion at the beginning of the launch. In terms of weapons, many popular weapons in the original work have been included, and the consistent free parts refitting of call of Duty series have also been inherited. In the battle, even “breathing back blood” and “sliding shovel shooting” have been retained. It can be said that Tianmei suffered from the loss of reduction degree in the last “all the troops out” because of this time, she has remembered the lesson, and has enough reduction degree Kungfu Online.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The call of duty mobile game has become a global blockbuster, not only because of the high popularity of IP/1697ce54b7e44eec8fdcd7a28e7dd25c.jpg" alt="The call of duty mobile game has become a global blockbuster, not only because of the high popularity of IP"><br>For many domestic players, it seems that the call of Duty series has always been a single player campaign, while the multi player battle is a “bonus” outside the campaign. In fact, the call of Duty series was originally a single FPS game dedicated to creating a sense of war presence. Later, it has been trying and exploring the multi player model to build a high degree of completion The unique multi player model, so that later, the volume of multi player model is much more than that of single player model, and the proportion is far more than that of single player model. Today’s call of duty has been maintaining a sales volume of tens of millions in overseas markets, to a large extent, thanks to its now excellent multi player model. Although the name of “call of duty” is well known in China, there are not many core players who are really interested in the series. The core audience of “call of duty” series is the host players in the overseas market, and the base number of domestic core players may only account for less than one tenth of them, which is why many domestic players can not understand why the series One of the reasons why the multiplayer model is so popular.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The call of duty mobile game has become a global blockbuster, not only because of the high popularity of IP/1b5329b6a2a144ec96768bf09d5266fe.jpg" alt="The call of duty mobile game has become a global blockbuster, not only because of the high popularity of IP"><br>    concluding remarks<br>Regardless of the reputation of Tencent’s call of duty ol, at least there is no doubt that Tencent has delivered a very satisfactory answer to many players this time. The high popularity and high reputation of the game have proved everything. As for whether the popularity of “chicken eating” game can be surpassed in China, we need to wait until the release of the national clothing number to make observation, but at least one thing can be sure is that the quality of this game and the achievements it made at the beginning of its launch are enough to catch up with his “rivals”. However, in the future, whether this work can maintain this level, we have to Cicada.</p>
