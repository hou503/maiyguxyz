        <p>Nowadays, almost all mainstream game works adopt 3D game pictures, which are very smooth and comfortable to play. This is not a strange thing at present. After all, with the development of video games, players’ cognition of the game is much higher than before. Everyone knows that the low frame number (too violent fluctuation) of the game will make the game perform badly In order to solve this problem, most players have been able to understand the meaning of video options in the game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The concept of frames and pictures will affect the game experience started from this racing game of the last century/271847270a0e42d9b62e413efa3d6452.jpg" alt="The concept of frames and pictures will affect the game experience started from this racing game of the last century"><br>We can have today’s game experience without the research and improvement of development technology by game manufacturers. In the early years, games were 2D pixel mosaics, but in fact, due to technical limitations, although the concept of 3D games appeared early, it has not been well developed. The early 3D games not only had rough pictures and low fluency, but also had to play all the functions of the hardware at that time to run reluctantly. At one time, people thought that 3D games were nothing more than that. Until the emergence of a arcade racing game called sleepwalking America, it really subverted people’s cognition and set a benchmark for subsequent works.</p>
<h1 id="Full-3D"><a href="#Full-3D" class="headerlink" title="Full 3D"></a>Full 3D</h1><p>In the early years, most developers didn’t have a clear understanding of the real 3D games. They believed that players only need to feel the “three-dimensional sense” from the game screen when playing, which can be called 3D. Freehand drawing a cube on a plane is the simplest 3D image. The original 3D is to bring this concept into the game to design 3D game images, rather than using 3D modeling as is now common. There was a “3D fever” in the game circle for a while. Many games like to add a 3D after the title of the game (now it is mostly seen in hand games). At that time, a variety of so-called “3D games” appeared. Although some games are difficult to be called “true 3D”, although the performance is amazing, it is difficult to be satisfied with the performance of fluency.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The concept of frames and pictures will affect the game experience started from this racing game of the last century/f26b6fe06744434a8d223c804fe454b6.jpg" alt="The concept of frames and pictures will affect the game experience started from this racing game of the last century"><br>“Sonic 3D Big Bang” named 3D but without 3D content<br>In the 1980s, Japan’s Sega company was flourishing in the field of arcade games. Their arcade represents the highest game development technology and the best human-computer interaction experience at that time. These skills are closely related to a person named Suzuki Yu. Under the leadership of Ling Muyu, Sega’s AM2 research and development department took the lead in exploring high frame rate 3D games. Many driving games developed by him, such as hang on and outrun, have very fast game rhythm and smooth picture expression. They use 2D layers to zoom and overlay to show the effect of “Pseudo 3D”, but the Pseudo 3D is still Pseudo 3D after all, which is not a small distance from the real game image modeled by full 3D Saturn.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The concept of frames and pictures will affect the game experience started from this racing game of the last century/79c38d309a94486bb74426128ecb36a4.jpg" alt="The concept of frames and pictures will affect the game experience started from this racing game of the last century"><br>Outrun, one of the greatest racing games<br>In 1992, AM2 launched the 3D racing game “VR racing car” based on the original model arcade version. At this time, they are trying to create a real full 3D screen game by themselves. Before that, nanmenggong has launched “winning run” as the first full 3D racing game in history, and the screen performance of “VR racing car” is undoubtedly better than the former. It is worth mentioning that the vehicle and map of the game are modeled by full 3D polygons, while only the sky and background of the game are 2D images, while the fluency of the background can reach 60 frames. Although the performance of the game has been excellent, there is still a gap from their ideal performance. Their next step is to improve the quality of the image and the number of frames at the same time.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The concept of frames and pictures will affect the game experience started from this racing game of the last century/e615c693e3be40e0af7aaf3e05e1b6f8.jpg" alt="The concept of frames and pictures will affect the game experience started from this racing game of the last century"><br>VR racing (the picture is the NS transplant version, but the picture is the same as the original version)</p>
<h1 id="Daytona"><a href="#Daytona" class="headerlink" title="Daytona"></a>Daytona</h1><p>With Suzuki Yu to study high frame rate 3D games, there is another famous gamer named Yue Nianyang. He participated in the development of VR racing. Two years after VR racing went public, mingyuenianyang got the chance to develop a game as a producer, and his work is the benchmark level Daytona USA. In two years, SEGA and AM2 have developed the second generation of model arcade, which is several times more powerful than the previous one, so it can also provide better picture performance. This arcade is a joint production of SEGA and an aerospace company, and the latter provides Sega with their system for 3D graphics operation, so the model can have such powerful performance parameters.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The concept of frames and pictures will affect the game experience started from this racing game of the last century/d13603f83bb24e44970b1a2da3b0a223.jpg" alt="The concept of frames and pictures will affect the game experience started from this racing game of the last century"><br>Original arcade screen<br>There is a very popular race in the United States called NASCAR racing. People who have a little knowledge of car culture will probably know that the core point of this race is the “wrestling war” between cars. Compared with the general professional race, NASCAR is more rough and passionate. NASCAR organizes more than 2000 Games every year, taking March as the beginning of a new season. The first game of each season, “Daytona 500” is the most important and greatest game in NASCAR’s history. Not to mention how the name of “sleepwalking America” came from, but it can be sure that this game is based on this event, And the primary difficulty track in the game is based on the well-known detona international track as the prototype.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The concept of frames and pictures will affect the game experience started from this racing game of the last century/2a556c29f6de47a7a499ee4a72437a8c.jpg" alt="The concept of frames and pictures will affect the game experience started from this racing game of the last century"><br>Nasca’s style is full of smoke<br>Back to the game, “dream back to America” is the first game developed by using the model 2 arcade, which can only be described as “unprecedented” in the picture performance. If the picture in the game is put in the present view, although it is old, it is difficult to appear the idea of “ugly”. Dream back to America is the first 3D game to use “material filtering (also called texture filtering)” technology, which reduces the graininess and sharp edge of the map in the game, making the material of the game look very smooth and soft. For example, its visual perception is very close to the highest quality “anti terrorist elite 1.6”, although this system follows in the game now It can be seen here, but at that time, it was the only one in Sega.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The concept of frames and pictures will affect the game experience started from this racing game of the last century/bb4fa4c4293b4938bb5d94d717ecd042.jpg" alt="The concept of frames and pictures will affect the game experience started from this racing game of the last century"><br>Simple comparison with and without material filtering (no filtering material on the left)<br>The key point is that sleepwalk America is the first full 3D game that can reach 60 frames, and nothing is more important than the processing speed for a racing game. If the scene refresh rate of the map can’t keep up with the high-speed driving of the players, it will be easy to make a play error, but there has never been such a problem in sleepwalk America. Later, Sega also transplanted sleepwalk America to various home computer platforms, and even launched exclusive versions for PCs, but the sales volume is still not very ideal, because for the players at that time, only this arcade version of sleepwalk America had the best and best experience in 3D games.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The concept of frames and pictures will affect the game experience started from this racing game of the last century/57c9f991cc8f4d50af195db34217b061.jpg" alt="The concept of frames and pictures will affect the game experience started from this racing game of the last century"><br>High definition transplant version of PS3 host in 2011<br>End of<br>It’s difficult to compare the performance of model 2 with that of the home computer in the same period. If the transplanted version of “sleepwalking America” is either too poor in picture or too low in frame number, it’s hard to get the same game experience as the arcade version, although it’s the same game content as the arcade version. It is also these general versions of home computers that make players realize for the first time the importance of pictures and frames for the game experience, and pay more attention to the hardware performance of the platform.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The concept of frames and pictures will affect the game experience started from this racing game of the last century/d7f96408e4044c2f824a10cd5acf518f.jpg" alt="The concept of frames and pictures will affect the game experience started from this racing game of the last century"><br>“Sleepwalking America: Championship” has made great progress, but it is basically the same as this generation<br>As for the arcade version of sleepwalking America, there have been four works launched on the arcade platform so far, and the second and third generations are separated by 18 years. Now, the latest work sleepwalking America: Championship supports eight people to fight online at the same time, which is really a party game for family. During this period, although Sega did not forget the work that made countless brilliant achievements for him, it was more just to put it on more platforms to let more players experience it. As for those players who are used to playing top 3A works, whether they can accept this very old game picture depends on whether they can accept the contrast between hamburger and egg hamburger.</p>
