        <p>When it comes to the word “brush”, it’s estimated that all players will associate RPG with the same type of game. For the new generation of players, it seems that the so-called RPG is the same as those game types of fighting strange explosive equipment. As for whether to shoot with a gun or cut with a sword, it doesn’t matter. The key is whether the players can brush happily. Nowadays, these games are collectively referred to as action role-playing (ARPG). Compared with the traditional turn RPG game, it is undoubtedly more refreshing and addictive. It seems that ARPG is also easier to win the favor of players than the traditional RPG.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The most powerful player in action role-playing games, Diablo is 23 years old/8fbd7c3579dd461d91626a53e3e46741.jpg" alt="The most powerful player in action role-playing games, Diablo is 23 years old"><br>In fact, the type of ARPG is not a very new type, even it has been some years, but to make this type last for a long time, we have to talk about a popular game of ARPG.<br>If you want to choose one of the most popular works from the ARPG game, it is the series “Diablo” produced by Blizzard, and the domestic players prefer to call it “big pineapple”. “Big pineapple” first exposed players to the concept of “brush brush”. Although this game type is not the first one of big pineapple, it has gathered the advantages of other works in the industry, corrected and innovated them, thus gaining an unparalleled position. Now, the highly watched Diablo 4 has finally been officially released, and it’s time to talk about this 23 year old legend series.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The most powerful player in action role-playing games, Diablo is 23 years old/5327f6871fe147e981e9353ec39d5a71.jpg" alt="The most powerful player in action role-playing games, Diablo is 23 years old"><br>Diablo<br>Diablo, the homophonic translation of Diablo, the name can be the meaning of “devil” in Spanish, or the name of the Horned Dragon in “Monster Hunter”. In the game of Diablo, the origin of the name is not so sophisticated, but simply because “father of darkness” David Breivik lived in contracosta County, California, USA as a child Danville, a subordinate City, and not far from his home there is a mountain called Diablo, which is not so famous, but if you climb the top of the mountain, you can see most of California’s scenery. David thinks the name is cool, and he thinks it will be used one day in the future, but he doesn’t know the Spanish meaning of the name. When the game was approved, he hoped to complete his childhood dream, but the meaning coincides with the theme of the game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The most powerful player in action role-playing games, Diablo is 23 years old/7dd783cdd6b04529a345d191926b529b.jpg" alt="The most powerful player in action role-playing games, Diablo is 23 years old"><br>Diablo mountain<br>After growing up, David became a programmer, and established “vulture” studio with two brothers Schaeffer. The design of Diablo was largely influenced by the classic game “rogue” and the game “dragon and dungeon” in his early years, such as random map, falling equipment and props on the computer, round round calculation of fighting monsters, starting from scratch when he died, etc, And the game mode is like “XCOM” like the turn to take the grid. At that time, blizzard was just founded. Before that, vultures and blizzard had met each other at the game exhibition. Blizzard made a lot of money with Warcraft. In order to get development funds, vultures hope to cooperate with blizzard. Blizzard said they can help, but they need to change the game to RTS game mode, and vultures, of course, do No, after all, all their designs for the game are to make the game into a turn system. If it is changed, it is no different from making a new game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The most powerful player in action role-playing games, Diablo is 23 years old/1743e5d104de4b2383cafc1462b30fb4.jpg" alt="The most powerful player in action role-playing games, Diablo is 23 years old"><br>“Rogue”</p>
<h1 id="different-ARPG"><a href="#different-ARPG" class="headerlink" title="different ARPG"></a>different ARPG</h1><p>In order to get the support of Blizzard, David chose to change it. After all, the game can’t be made. It’s useless to say anything. By chance, he tried to set the waiting time of any operation in the game to 0, but it formed a very amazing effect. The protagonist can move freely in the map and fight with the enemy in a fast-paced and non delayed manner , although the mechanism is basically the same as the original idea, it makes the game play much more enjoyable. Strictly speaking, the modified “Diablo” is more like a disguised RTS game, but only one person can control the unit. Blizzard hopes to change the game to RTS just because it wants to abandon the turn system design, but the modified result is beyond Blizzard’s expectation. It immediately decides to buy the vulture and put the game into the bag, so the vulture is renamed blizzard In the north, the development conditions of Diablo are much better.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The most powerful player in action role-playing games, Diablo is 23 years old/58e78da395d24dff88437c2a4a6fe968.jpg" alt="The most powerful player in action role-playing games, Diablo is 23 years old"><br>Dark destroyer<br>The first generation of “Diablo” was born in 1996. Its playing method has been a very familiar upgraded explosive equipment for fighting monsters. Blizzard has added the function of multi person online to the game, which makes the playability and variables of the game improve again. Although it has no brain to play, it is far less profound than the traditional round RPG, but it makes the players realize that the original RPG game is also the first time It can be so refreshing. The theme of “Diablo” refers to the horror stories and films and TV works of Gothic style in the early years. It has a dark style comparable to it. Meanwhile, Blizzard hopes to introduce some bloody and violent elements into the game, which can add a unique aesthetic feeling to the game. In the early years, the refreshing type of game is represented by “destroyer” I think maybe these elements can make the game more comfortable, but it turns out that even the early generation works are still very cool when playing, but it’s easy to get tired after a long time.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The most powerful player in action role-playing games, Diablo is 23 years old/a9e5b05174184485aaaa02215d855748.jpg" alt="The most powerful player in action role-playing games, Diablo is 23 years old"><br>It’s easy to see such a picture for a long time</p>
<p>After the first generation of games went on the market, they were highly praised and became Blizzard’s best-selling works next to Warcraft II. Many media gave them full marks or nearly full marks. Although they were not suitable for children to play, they could not deny their excellent quality. After the success of the first generation of works, Blizzard began to take advantage of the hot iron to prepare for the sequel. With the foresight of the first generation, they also have more and more interesting ideas and inspiration for this game. Although the development of the second generation largely reuses the materials in the previous work, it has made great efforts in the type, attribute, value of the equipment and the talent skills of each profession, which greatly improves the playability of the game itself. With a more perfect battle net online system, the players can also get a better online experience when online, and different players and different professions at the same time Different skills can combine different effects to make the game more profound. According to blizzard, it seems that dark 2 is the complete version of the game in their mind.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The most powerful player in action role-playing games, Diablo is 23 years old/502c597715cd4302a9c84a94fce56f8c.jpg" alt="The most powerful player in action role-playing games, Diablo is 23 years old"><br>Diablo 2<br>I don’t think I need to introduce the influence of Diablo 2 too much here. Quite a few players are exposed to Blizzard from this game, and Blizzard is also famous in the real sense of this game. Even the most well-known “StarCraft” and “world of Warcraft 3” are all works from behind. Unfortunately, due to the internal reasons of the company’s senior management, several core members and founders of beiblizzard left Blizzard not long after the development of the expansion film “king of destruction”. At that time, the development of “Diablo 3” was close to 50%. After reading their development content, Blizzard headquarters, which lost several core creators, thought that the design of the game did not match theirs, so it decided to overturn and redo the whole thing. The former blizzard was disbanded, and the remaining employees either joined the headquarters or lost their jobs, which was the whole 11 years. During this period, too many games had covered the light of dark.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The most powerful player in action role-playing games, Diablo is 23 years old/c945939ef07a4b00bccbccdeedb5a4c1.jpg" alt="The most powerful player in action role-playing games, Diablo is 23 years old"><br>Most people are more familiar with this picture<br>    concluding remarks<br>And the following story is probably known to the fans of Diablo: Although the online Diablo 3 in 2012 has been improved in all aspects in terms of system and screen, the quality of the game can’t be compared with that of the previous work, and then it gradually recovers the reputation by continuous updating and improvement, but it still fails to reach the height of the previous work. It seems that Blizzard’s “Diablo 3” is not the work that fans expect, which directly leads to that the work has not had the same high degree of attention in the following years, and even Blizzard has no plan for the future of the game itself.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The most powerful player in action role-playing games, Diablo is 23 years old/794d8a90e56148e7a6e2b6a1143f3986.jpg" alt="The most powerful player in action role-playing games, Diablo is 23 years old"><br>Dark 3 is not a failure, but it is not a success. This failure may be remembered by Blizzard for a lifetime. From the media reports, it seems that dark 4 finally has its own flavor. As for whether Blizzard can get back the bad food in Dark 4, that’s another story.</p>
