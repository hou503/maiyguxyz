        <p>At the end of last month, the RPG game “horse riding and killing 2: Lord”, which has been eagerly awaited by numerous players, officially announced that it will carry out limited game testing, and will soon release a public test. It’s been 11 years since the game was released. Before that, the players’ cognition of qihew 2 was only in the development log released by the developer taleworlds every other time. It’s hard to update the development log, but it’s too late to know when the game will be finished and listed. And the news of this test really makes many players who have waited for the flowers to fade one after another to have a chance to see the real face of the game in person.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The production of rough pictures is backward, but the sequel can make players wait 11 years for horse riding and killing/1440020262694127a1e821169f198629.jpg" alt="The production of rough pictures is backward, but the sequel can make players wait 11 years for horse riding and killing"><br>A good game doesn’t need a very good picture, and it doesn’t need a good handle, in the end, as long as it’s fun enough. “Horse riding and chop” is a rough game, but it is still active in the past 11 years. Even the well-known longevity game “ancient scroll 5” is only eight years. Some people may say that the reason why the game can survive today is that it is inseparable from the community and mod, which is no problem, but this is only one of the reasons for its vitality.</p>
<p>#A game that   doesn’t play for<br>In 2005, an independent game called “warrior” began to spread in the forum of Military game enthusiasts. This is a medieval background simulation war RPG game, in which players can form their own troops and lead them to the battlefield. The picture of the game is very rough, but this kind of slightly unique playing method seems very interesting to people. And the biggest highlight of the game is that this work is just like ancient scroll 3. Even if the players don’t do anything, all kinds of things are happening in different parts of the world. There are NPC from different countries and regions fighting with people from other countries everywhere. The goal of the players is to strengthen their own forces and drive out several other major NPC’s to kill the whole continent This kind of playing method is not uncommon in strategy games, but it is unprecedented in an ARPG game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The production of rough pictures is backward, but the sequel can make players wait 11 years for horse riding and killing/2337036af805499cae9d39b1a97e698b.jpg" alt="The production of rough pictures is backward, but the sequel can make players wait 11 years for horse riding and killing"><br>The similarity between “warrior” and “riding and chopping” can be seen<br>The rough little game became popular, and two developers of the homeopathy game became known: armagan Yavuz, from Turkey, and his wife Ipek, who worked with him to develop the game. Although the production of the game is rough, it has a high degree of completion in content. When the media asked why they want to make such a game, they said that the main reason is that the games on the market can’t meet their tastes. They just want to make a product they want. Many players said that if they have the idea of polishing the game and selling it on the market, They are willing to help the couple.<br>The so-called encouragement of players is the greatest support for developers. The couple readily agreed, and then they quit their original job with one bite of their teeth and one foot of their feet. They focused on making games, and set up taleworlds for other players to communicate with each other and share game development tools. At this stage, the name of the game was changed from warrior to Mount &amp; blade and sell game serial numbers online to maintain game development.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The production of rough pictures is backward, but the sequel can make players wait 11 years for horse riding and killing/8b7eb149442a459c8e9fef2ae3a4f532.jpg" alt="The production of rough pictures is backward, but the sequel can make players wait 11 years for horse riding and killing"><br>At present, the group photo of taleworlds team is Yavuz in the middle and wife Ipek in the right</p>
<h1 id="famous"><a href="#famous" class="headerlink" title="famous"></a>famous</h1><p>Few people know that in the whole taleworlds, most of the members are the authors who have made mod specially for other games. They are not so much “involved in game development” as developing mod for this game. In fact, it’s true that the finished product of “horse riding and cutting” is almost like a piece of work made of countless mods. By the time of signing with Paradox Interactive (P club for short) in 2007, the game had risen from 24MB at the beginning to 280MB, more than tenfold. Every design idea and inspiration in the game comes from the players in various forums and the mod authors who participated in the development. For the great progress of the game, the couple expressed their gratitude for all the participation in the development of the game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The production of rough pictures is backward, but the sequel can make players wait 11 years for horse riding and killing/374bb9fbf96d4c1f9daf0a7ca6958241.jpg" alt="The production of rough pictures is backward, but the sequel can make players wait 11 years for horse riding and killing"><br>Screenshot of early game<br>In 2008, the official version of the game finally went public with the help of P club, which is now known as the “original”. In the initial version, the game is just a medieval game worthy of the name of horse fight, but compared with the “initial version” a few years ago, the content and map of the game are much larger than the original scale, and before the release, the development team also added the “Friendliness” between the “camp” system and each NPC to the game.<br>But when the game is officially released, there are hundreds of game MODS and dozens of game mods produced by the community members of taleworlds. Yes, you can even write your own script for the game (similar to the expansion film, which can experience different content from the original version). With the good reputation accumulated before going public, the game sold 1 million sets when it was officially launched, and the players and the media were also highly praised.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The production of rough pictures is backward, but the sequel can make players wait 11 years for horse riding and killing/d8a3403626d54c149c5894b9be339b3b.jpg" alt="The production of rough pictures is backward, but the sequel can make players wait 11 years for horse riding and killing"><br>Original game cover<br>When the game was not officially launched, there were many fans of “qihew” on the other side of the ocean. At that time, the name of “qihew” was not known. The real opportunity for the game to become known to most people is the release of the independent expansion film “riding and chopping: Battle Group” two years later. In this expansion, the development team added political system, marriage system and multiplayer online to the game, but expanded various new contents, making the game more like a “medieval Simulator” in the overall experience.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The production of rough pictures is backward, but the sequel can make players wait 11 years for horse riding and killing/b02ec0e9a5e14a42af9dc4c937a8569d.jpg" alt="The production of rough pictures is backward, but the sequel can make players wait 11 years for horse riding and killing"><br>This picture is familiar to all players of “riding and chopping”<br>Players can do what they want to do in the real sense of the overhead medieval world. You can recruit members to set up their own doors, or you can choose to join other countries to instigate relations between countries to reap the benefits, or you can be a wilderness Ranger exploring the mainland, or you can be a businessman and peddler doing business. For the players who don’t like the overhead world very much, the developers have also launched fire and sword, an independent documentary based on the real historical background. With the help of P club’s development of historical strategy games over the years, the inside information and connotation of the series of riding and chopping are becoming more and more profound, both in political design and historical restoration are very careful and rigorous.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The production of rough pictures is backward, but the sequel can make players wait 11 years for horse riding and killing/85c501e975944a1da9e27f3fbda9d5b8.jpg" alt="The production of rough pictures is backward, but the sequel can make players wait 11 years for horse riding and killing"><br>In fire and sword, firearm and more perfect economic system are added, but the heat is far less than that of the War Regiment</p>
<h1 id="tail-the-next-step-is-the-future"><a href="#tail-the-next-step-is-the-future" class="headerlink" title="tail: the next step is the future"></a>tail: the next step is the future</h1><p>“My world” sells well. In fact, it’s also an independent game. No matter how high the game quality of “ride and chop” is, it can’t be called 3a. These two games have a common feature, that is, they look very rough, even rough, but they are very fun, the fun even many 3A works can not match. Riding and chopping can only be achieved so far with the attention of the fans and the perseverance of the producers. Back to the question we mentioned at the beginning, why the vitality of riding and chopping series can be longer than that of laogun5? The existence of mod and the open-source nature of the game ontology are just one of the reasons. The main reason is that it has the measurement of being able to contain all kinds of rivers.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The production of rough pictures is backward, but the sequel can make players wait 11 years for horse riding and killing/317a73658b774a008b854ffd374235ee.jpg" alt="The production of rough pictures is backward, but the sequel can make players wait 11 years for horse riding and killing"><br>Although there is no huge and beautiful map in the game, and even the monarch of each city can only live in a small one mu and three Fen land, the whole game has the freedom that many masterpieces cannot give. It doesn’t matter that the details are not enough, but as a medieval RPG game, it has everything it should have and everything it doesn’t have. The game doesn’t force the players to do anything. The task is just a simple goal. The rest is left to the players’ own judgment. Compared with the “high freedom” and “open world” in other masterpieces, even in the Middle Ages In the case of insufficient technical force, it is obvious that the world of “riding and chopping” should be more free and open.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The production of rough pictures is backward, but the sequel can make players wait 11 years for horse riding and killing/1a5a3dbd13ba4b828bc02eef0c56287d.jpg" alt="The production of rough pictures is backward, but the sequel can make players wait 11 years for horse riding and killing"><br>You said that the hardcore of “qihewan”, the first one in “heaven: save”, was not satisfied. You said that “qihewan” is true. On details reduction, there are many games that can hang “qihewan”. Some people may say that “you can’t compare a game more than ten years ago with the current game”. But the reality is that although “qihewan” is very good in gameplay, it has been a game after all Behind the product of the times, and looking at the next generation will come, “qihew 2” is still slow to move.<br>The so-called waiting for the game to be released is like waiting for a new update. The more you love him, the more anxious you will feel. But even after so many years, we have waited. It doesn’t matter if the development team continues to polish it. It’s just a sincere hope that on the day when “qihew 2” is actually released, we can live up to the expectations of so many players we are looking forward to.</p>
