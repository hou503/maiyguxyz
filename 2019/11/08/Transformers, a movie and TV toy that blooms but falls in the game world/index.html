        <p>Towards the end of 2018, Paramount Pictures in the United States launched the latest personal work “Bumblebee” of “Transformers” series after several twists and turns. As we all know, before this, due to the chaos of plot logic and extremely inconsistent with the original character settings, and a large number of embedded advertisements in the film, the word-of-mouth of each work is gradually declining, neither fans nor passers-by audiences can agree that this is a “Transformers” work. After the change of director, “Bumblebee” has changed the shape of each transformer in the live action movie, from the theme of evil to the fetter between man and robot, and the new work of taking the emotional card has captured the hearts of the audience again, at the same time, it also makes this series have the hope of rejuvenating again.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Transformers, a movie and TV toy that blooms but falls in the game world/3de417e543a44f8a95a76902c2e176f6.jpg" alt="Transformers, a movie and TV toy that blooms but falls in the game world"><br>In any case, “Transformers” series started with selling toys. Each film and television work is just an auxiliary to promote the sales of toys. According to the different styles of cartoons, the styles of toys will change together. With the continuous improvement of the world view of transformers in various kinds of film and television works, it’s hard to say that we don’t need to play a game. There was a period when there was a transformer game in the field of game almost every other period of time, but somehow, it’s gone.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Transformers, a movie and TV toy that blooms but falls in the game world/25ead5a8f433414f9b62963545cbb83d.jpg" alt="Transformers, a movie and TV toy that blooms but falls in the game world"></p>
<h1 id="American-dolls-of-Oriental-origin"><a href="#American-dolls-of-Oriental-origin" class="headerlink" title="American dolls of Oriental origin"></a>American dolls of Oriental origin</h1><p>Since the 1960s, robot culture has been particularly popular in Japan. One of the manga masters “Astro Boy in the iron wall” is very popular. In the 1980s, the popularity of works such as “Doraemon” and “mobile fighter Gotha” made the influence of robot elements in Japan unusual. As the technology of the toy industry matures, Takara, a Japanese toy manufacturer, plans to launch a series of robot toys. Unlike before, these robots can be transformed into airplanes, sports cars, various weapons and even many common digital products in life. Each element is something that boys like very much. When combined, they will become more attractive, In addition to being able to deform, some robots can also be combined and assembled with each other to become larger and more handsome robots, which Takara named “dayaclone”. Today, dyakron continues to launch this new work (style is more like science fiction robot), and the shape and design of these deformable robots are also more handsome and flexible, which are deeply loved by fans in Japan.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Transformers, a movie and TV toy that blooms but falls in the game world/c88598feb78746d4b07a9fd576a803ac.jpg" alt="Transformers, a movie and TV toy that blooms but falls in the game world"><br>Dai Ya clone<br>After daiakron became popular in the Japanese market, many European and American toy manufacturers saw business opportunities from it, so they introduced this popular product to the local market. Among many manufacturers, a company named Hasbro recognized Takara through daiakron. They had a far-reaching idea. So they flew all the way to Japan to seek cooperation with Takara, bought the role copyright of several branches of Takara daiakron’s series, and brought it back to the United States to build a brand-new brand. The corner of this new brand Takara is still in charge of color design, while Hasbro named the new series transformers for the European and American markets. Hasbro also learned from the Japanese toy sales experience, designed a very detailed setting for each character in the transformers series, and shaped a huge world view for it to launch relevant animation, which is the first “Transformers” work touched by many old fans.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Transformers, a movie and TV toy that blooms but falls in the game world/fc85e79c90e944c29a25dbecbd124796.jpg" alt="Transformers, a movie and TV toy that blooms but falls in the game world"></p>
<h1 id="adaptation-period"><a href="#adaptation-period" class="headerlink" title="adaptation period"></a>adaptation period</h1><p>Soon, the series of transformers spread all over the streets, almost no one knows the names of “prime” and “Megatron”. After returning to Japan, this series from a long way back is another gesture, and its influence even exceeds that of his predecessor, daiyakelon. “Transformers” is no longer a simple series of players and animation, but also has gradually become an influential big IP. The surrounding products are also selling vigorously, and naturally there is no lack of a video game. According to the available historical records, the earliest “Transformers” game was born in 1995. It is the exclusive work of Commodore 64. In essence, it’s a kind of arcade style light gun shooting game. You only need to click the enemy to fire. As the main character, transformers didn’t even appear in the game several times. I believe fans want to be sure that it’s not this.<br>The first game that looks good in the real sense is FC game Optimus Prime’s secret, which is only released in Japan. This is a horizontal action game, but although there is Optimus Prime in the title, the protagonist of the game is the second generation of leaders who are familiar with the sky. This game is not only unreasonable in design, but also the transformer’s biggest characteristic “deformation” has no use in the game , it’s just a wave of enthusiasm, so this game is also a piece of rubbish in the eyes of many fans.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Transformers, a movie and TV toy that blooms but falls in the game world/de2679910a12454591e1881730621397.jpg" alt="Transformers, a movie and TV toy that blooms but falls in the game world"><br>The secret of Optimus Prime<br>For many years since then, transformers has been launching new works of various styles, but the quality is not ideal. Until 2007, the real-life version of “Transformers” directed by Michael Bay, which I mentioned at the beginning of the article, was released. The more realistic and handsome shape made the big IP with a history of nearly 30 years come to life again. At this time, the “Transformers” was more in line with the modern aesthetic, and the realistic style was easier to make a game, so I focused on film and television adaptation Pin’s moviemaker came out and took over the work of movie adaptation. This generation of works is the most impressive one for the author. The game well restores the deformation effect of strong metal friction in the movie, and adds many original contents. However, the game itself has a low playability and a weak sense of attack. Most of the branch contents are mainly collected, and the media even fail to pass the evaluation, but one code for one code, with different roles’ emphasis It’s cool that the attack can fly the enemy far away and take up the facilities in the city and throw them at each other.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Transformers, a movie and TV toy that blooms but falls in the game world/a9538e0e469a48ed9aeb5b7ff5676325.jpg" alt="Transformers, a movie and TV toy that blooms but falls in the game world"></p>
<h1 id="the-fall-of-Cybertron"><a href="#the-fall-of-Cybertron" class="headerlink" title="the fall of Cybertron"></a>the fall of Cybertron</h1><p>Since then, live action films have launched new works in two years, and adaptation games have also been launched almost together with the films. As the article said at the beginning, the word-of-mouth of films is lower than that of generations, and so is the game. Even when the film is released to the fifth film, adaptation works have not been launched directly. Naturally, the influence of the movie doesn’t need to be said much, but in the aspect of dynamic vision, we want to put each generation’s works on as many platforms as possible, so there are several different versions of a generation of games. The quality of the PC version and the main board that occupy the majority of the movie itself is not very good, let alone the screen and content castrate the more ruthless palm version. After the second-generation movie “Revenge of Fallen King Kong” was launched by Activision, a new round of cooperation was reached with Hasbro. It is planned to launch a series of original style works based on the setting of “Transformers” and submit them to other studios for production, which is called “battle of Cybertron”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Transformers, a movie and TV toy that blooms but falls in the game world/fa56729e1ae04baea2a2d662ec9ce7d5.jpg" alt="Transformers, a movie and TV toy that blooms but falls in the game world"><br>Battle of Cybertron<br>Based on the original work, the series strengthens the science fiction elements and integrates the realistic style, forming a unique style, breaking away from the limitation of the inherent framework, and focusing the story on Saibotan, the mother star of transformers. This work can highlight the unique pleasure of “transfiguration battle” in transformers to the greatest extent. This work integrates action and shooting, and integrates the overall playability and The production quality is better than that of the film adaptation. Some players even say that this is the best “Transformers” game ever. And two years later, motion TV brought the sequel “the fall of Cybertron”. This work was made by the original team, which has been improved in all aspects. The score of the game has broken through the bottleneck of eight points unprecedented. Fans and passers-by are full of praise for it. In many people’s eyes, it may be difficult to surpass this work in the future. However, the fans of transformers are only a small part of the game circle. Even though “the fall of Cybertron” has received unprecedented praise, the sales volume has not achieved the same results as the public praise. Unfortunately, mobile TV no longer plans to launch a sequel to the series.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Transformers, a movie and TV toy that blooms but falls in the game world/4b502cbf8a52446da5d72d508f8c86a9.jpg" alt="Transformers, a movie and TV toy that blooms but falls in the game world"><br>The fall of Cybertron<br>    concluding remarks<br>In October 2015, Activision plans to make its last blog, and launched a next-generation work “Transformers: destruction” in the original cartoon style. It is worth mentioning that this work is developed by platinum studio, a famous action game developer. Although it can circle in the performance of the battle, there are problems in the design of the game itself in the system and the planning of the game’s branch content Therefore, the score of the game is basically the same as that of “battle of Cybertron”, which is quite reasonable. However, at this time, the transformers in the game field has already lost its enthusiasm, and the sales volume of the game is not ideal, and even the PS4 version of the Bank of China has been launched specially for Chinese players, which still fails to pull back the situation. This dynamic vision is to completely put down the IP of “Transformers”, which is also regarded as propaganda It’s the end of the development of transformers 3A game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Transformers, a movie and TV toy that blooms but falls in the game world/0b9297e28781461ca4d47a4e7e138b5b.jpg" alt="Transformers, a movie and TV toy that blooms but falls in the game world"><br>Transformers: Destruction<br>In the field of toys, transformers is known as the second incredible toy in the world (the first is Lego), because the design idea of each product is really unimaginable; in the field of film and television, there are many animation works of transformers, and most of them have good reputation. Although the film has suffered Waterloo before, it is seen as a pure “popcorn” movie It’s OK, the fighting scene is also quite wonderful, and then it turns around after changing the producer. As for the game field, it seems that the transformers series has never really been popular, it’s just an accessory of the accessory products, maybe only fans who really love this series will try, and the base of this kind of fans is a little pitiful.<br>Transformers carries too many memories of our childhood. Maybe it’s time for him to have a good rest, but Hasbro still hopes to sell toys to earn money. So in the future, maybe we can see the struggle between Optimus Prime and Megatron, but we can’t know how this process will work.</p>
