        <p>I like American RPG games very much, especially radiation series. Many years ago, I had the idea that we all know that the copyright of radiation series now belongs to Bethesda company in the United States. Its representative work ancient scrolls series has a derivative online game named ancient scrolls ol, which has been in operation for many years. Although I haven’t played it, it seems that the game Quality is OK, so when will b society launch a “radiation” with multi person online elements? I feel that it should be very interesting to build a house together with online tasks.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Updating to the extinction of the sun radiation 76, gives itself a problem that will not be solved/741ea2db861a41ce96441ee588e51082.jpg" alt="Updating to the extinction of the sun radiation 76, gives itself a problem that will not be solved"><br>I believe that there must be more than one person with such an idea. With such a mindset, players have come to the online game “radiation 76”, which they thought had been realized for many years. However, it is unexpected that the overall quality difference of this work in the initial stage is unimaginable, and the controversy surrounding this game is from the beginning of the publication stage It’s always there. Up to now, nearly a year has passed since the game was released, so what about this so-called “update to the sun out” game?<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Updating to the extinction of the sun radiation 76, gives itself a problem that will not be solved/09028afa7ef34497bcfc63c4987618a8.jpg" alt="Updating to the extinction of the sun radiation 76, gives itself a problem that will not be solved"></p>
<h1 id="radiation-4-multiplayer-mode"><a href="#radiation-4-multiplayer-mode" class="headerlink" title="radiation 4 multiplayer mode"></a>radiation 4 multiplayer mode</h1><p>In fact, the development of radiation 76 had a plan as early as radiation 4 had not been completed. It was originally set as the multi person mode of radiation 4. All friends who have played radiation 4 should know that the content of this game is very scarce in the later stage, and the overall optimization and polishing are very problematic, obviously there are traces of catching up, so we can know that the development cycle of the game is very tight.<br>Since the development of the game ontology has been a bit laborious, there is no extra effort to make the multiplayer mode for the game. The style of agency B (here refers to the Bethesda game studio, referred to as BGS) is that the overall experience of the single player mode can not be sacrificed in any way. Although there is a real idea of multiplayer mode in the company, it can only be put aside temporarily, giving priority to the single player mode of radiation 4 After that, we will consider other contents. In 2014, zenimax, the parent company of group B, set up a “battle cry” studio focusing on online game development. The internal core staff of the studio had participated in the development and operation of “cybergenesis” and “Star Wars: the Old Republic”. Shortly after that, they distributed their “sub Era online game” war cry to Grandpa.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Updating to the extinction of the sun radiation 76, gives itself a problem that will not be solved/dbe0a2c261534a16b240cf4a704996a7.jpg" alt="Updating to the extinction of the sun radiation 76, gives itself a problem that will not be solved"><br>The third person action plus “Legion fortress” is “battle roar”<br>A month before the release of radiation 4, zhanhou studio faced a wave of layoffs for economic reasons, which led to the indefinite suspension of the online game called zhanhou. At this time, “radiation 4” has entered the stage of sale, but its development members did not get the rest time, they still need to continue to develop DLC for the game, and the war roar studio is just idle now, so the chief producer of B society, Todd Howard, found war roar: “do you want to try to make a separate multi person mode for our” radiation 4 “<br>Players familiar with BGS should know that BGS has been using the same engine for many years from the beginning of “ancient scroll 3: morning wind”. This engine is a special engine that focuses on the development of single player experience. Its algorithm is far from the way of making multiplayer games, and BGS itself lacks the development experience of multiplayer games, so How to deal with these problems is a big challenge for them (old scroll OL was developed by zenimax online).<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Updating to the extinction of the sun radiation 76, gives itself a problem that will not be solved/60a6e339f48c452da08211139b435fdd.jpg" alt="Updating to the extinction of the sun radiation 76, gives itself a problem that will not be solved"><br>Radiation 4</p>
<p>#Why is it 76?<br>In order to solve this problem, they had to create a new map, and the scale of this map must be larger than that of radiation 4. Agency B chose the east coast of the United States, which they are also familiar with, and West Virginia, which is far away from the main line of the radiation series. This is a very bold idea, because West Virginia is a state, not a district or a city. This is a crazy idea for BGS, which has only done two radiation works Ideas. The background of the game is set in 25 years after the World War II of radiation. All players come from a real “controlled shelter” (a real shelter for people’s protection). They need to return to the ground earlier than anyone before and be responsible for the reconstruction of the country. This shelter is No. 76, so it is named radiation 76. In short, as a pure online game, they need to It’s not an orthodox sequel to distinguish it from the main line of stand-alone works.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Updating to the extinction of the sun radiation 76, gives itself a problem that will not be solved/9a9bd2d19202400f99f3aff6f2a7d361.jpg" alt="Updating to the extinction of the sun radiation 76, gives itself a problem that will not be solved"><br>Radiation 76’s map is four times the size of the previous work, and it is much more exquisite than BGS’s previous work. After all, West Virginia is far away from the place where the war broke out, so the damage suffered here is relatively light, and many beautiful rural landscapes are preserved. Moreover, due to the different accidents in various regions, the environment and ecology in each region are also different.<br>Compared with the previous “radiation” works, the overall color is more bright, the last breath is still in but not so serious, and more people-friendly in sense, so it also attracts many players who have never been exposed to the “radiation” series. Before the release of radiation 76, Todd said that there would be no NPC in the whole game, which made many players lose their eyesight in an instant. The main player of radiation series has a high degree of freedom, which is reflected in both interaction and dialogue, and NPC is the key of the key. Suddenly, it was said that there was no NPC in the work, but from this point, people can’t help worrying about the game Quality.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Updating to the extinction of the sun radiation 76, gives itself a problem that will not be solved/3fb94c86f141437faff496906692f6b1.jpg" alt="Updating to the extinction of the sun radiation 76, gives itself a problem that will not be solved"></p>
<h1 id="lowest-rating-in-history"><a href="#lowest-rating-in-history" class="headerlink" title="lowest rating in history"></a>lowest rating in history</h1><p>Many players have made psychological preparation for “this game will thunder”, but it has brought greater impact to the players unexpectedly: the quality of the first version of the game server is very poor, the amount of bugs in the game itself is so large that each game will have a new experience, and the playing method of the game is very boring, neither like an online game, nor a single game, or always between the two Repeat the cross jump.<br>It’s true that club B has invested a lot in this game, and the design concept of the game is also very good, but it has made a very rough “four unlike”. This moment ignited the anger of the players. The game itself has a 3A level price and 3a level publicity, but the game itself does not even count as a semi-finished product, which is unacceptable to anyone. The score of the game once became the lowest in the whole “radiation” series. Even the “radiation: Iron and steel brotherhood (not that strategic version)” which sells dog meat with sheep’s head was a passing score, and the players came and went quickly. The players asked for a refund in succession. Even the retailers reduced the price of “radiation 76” less than a week after it was put on sale and half sold and half delivered. They hope that they can get along with each other as soon as possible The game is disconnected.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Updating to the extinction of the sun radiation 76, gives itself a problem that will not be solved/12a133696a7b4298a41e3f1efc783c69.jpg" alt="Updating to the extinction of the sun radiation 76, gives itself a problem that will not be solved"><br>I don’t know how many people have been touched by the song “take me home, country road” in the notice<br>Since then, there have been endless negative news about agency B, no matter in peripheral products or in a series of subsequent operation policies, which fully highlights BGS’s lack of experience in various aspects of online games. At this time, Todd came out to try to save the situation. They stepped up the bug repair speed and announced that each major update had a large number of new content added. This game will be updated all the time and will try their best to solve all the problems.<br>The first large-scale DLC “wild Appalachia” of the game was officially launched nearly five months after the game was released. The bug repair of the updated episode of the content finally changed the game from “can’t play at all” to “just play”. However, it’s still far from Todd’s envisaged posture, and the game still can’t be called fun. At the end of July this year, the game finally released the second large DLC news. In this version, new maps and replicas will be added, and the big escape mode will be added. It can be seen that this IP is also gradually improving.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Updating to the extinction of the sun radiation 76, gives itself a problem that will not be solved/1362ad4118f64d59b25ce2e68e342a92.jpg" alt="Updating to the extinction of the sun radiation 76, gives itself a problem that will not be solved"><br>Next update of radiation 76</p>
<p>#Conclusion<br>A friend who is also a fan of “radiation” said that “radiation” is a half dead IP, which is not easy to be supported by community B, but it is still half dead. This is true. If there is no agency B, there will be no “radiation” today. I believe that no fan would like to see this IP fall. However, the practice of agency B is not flattering. There are not a few game works that are updated and supplemented after selling semi-finished products at the price of 3a in the early stage, but few people can keep up with the difficulties. Most of them are the last half of the update Because the effect is not good and the road abandoned the pit, I really hope that “radiation 76” can gradually improve, otherwise some can take the beautiful scenery of West Virginia.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Updating to the extinction of the sun radiation 76, gives itself a problem that will not be solved/c7929c0217684d2fb0ae7bbb859ed81c.jpg" alt="Updating to the extinction of the sun radiation 76, gives itself a problem that will not be solved"><br>After the event, producer Todd once said: if at the beginning of the game release, all players with radiation 4 are provided with free testing qualification instead of pre order players, and the testing time is longer and the server is open all day, most problems may be solved before the release. The defeat of radiation 76 undoubtedly taught a lesson to B society. I hope their subsequent works will not repeat the same mistakes, and Todd is not just talking about it.</p>
