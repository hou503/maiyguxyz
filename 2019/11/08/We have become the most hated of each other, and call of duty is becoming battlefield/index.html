        <p>Recently, Kathy elcasey, chief marketing officer of nip of E-sports club, after watching the demonstration of the multiplayer mode of “call of Duty: modern war”, expressed her own view: the playing method and style of “call of duty” are more and more like “battlefield”, while the playing method of “battlefield” is not satisfactory though it has been improved in every generation Already good enough, hope EA can step up the pace to improve the game playing method.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/We have become the most hated of each other, and call of duty is becoming battlefield/1830d472a3304ce9add915fcb0e8c8fc.jpg" alt="We have become the most hated of each other, and call of duty is becoming battlefield"><br>Why does the marketing officer of an E-sports Club give directions to the game that can’t be related to himself? Because he has another identity: former global brand manager of EA company. This is true. In an interview with foreign media a while ago, IW, the development team of the call of Duty series, said that they would add a multiplayer model to the new work, which could hold 100 people, and named it “ground war”, to divide the players into battalions of 50 people on each side for confrontation. You should know that the highlight of the battlefield series is the large-scale operation of 32v32, but this time the number of people in the call of duty has nearly doubled compared with the battlefield series, and it not only retains the original fighting style in playing method, but also increases the “sense of presence” in the game. If both of them can be done well, it is undoubtedly a danger for battlefield Things.</p>
<h1 id="dice-yes-EA-wrong"><a href="#dice-yes-EA-wrong" class="headerlink" title="dice yes, EA wrong"></a>dice yes, EA wrong</h1><p>Let’s review the experience of battlefield 5 from its release to the present: in short, although the game background has been pulled back to World War II after many years, it seems that this World War II is not the same as what we remember. There are many settings in the game that are extremely against the background of the World War II era, such as women soldiers walking everywhere, weapons and equipment that are inconsistent with the times, and so on. These problems have been controversial since the game was just released, which makes people really confused about which parallel universe World War II it is. Players have launched a petition on the Internet, hoping that EA can respect history and modify the settings, but EA didn’t mean to change the settings back, on the contrary, the high-level officials have publicly expressed that “the people who let us modify the game have no education.” These scenes are all possible things. If you don’t like them, you can not buy them.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/We have become the most hated of each other, and call of duty is becoming battlefield/d1bcec16d0394d12b743f1ac5cd4764f.jpg" alt="We have become the most hated of each other, and call of duty is becoming battlefield"><br>In the second picture on the left, it seems that the British female soldiers equipped with prosthetics and sniper guns never appeared in World War II<br>It’s hard to imagine that the disastrous comments came from the top leaders of EA. Since EA officials have said that we can not buy if we don’t like it, then we don’t buy it. The players decided to speak with practical actions. The main players of “battlefield” series are mainly distributed in overseas host platforms, so the sales volume of the first week of the physical version of the game is not even higher than that of the previous generation of work “battlefield: hard battle”, so EA’s share price has also plummeted all the way, and the senior leaders who made the disaster speech have no choice but to resign. As for the operation of EA, dice, the developer, did not give any response and expression, which is not hard to understand. After all, they are only employees of EA. How to do the game can only follow the leader’s arrangement, and they are only responsible for bowing their heads and working silently.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/We have become the most hated of each other, and call of duty is becoming battlefield/dadd34fa78db45ca8e0d6d5b5ef9ea32.jpg" alt="We have become the most hated of each other, and call of duty is becoming battlefield"><br>No discussion on the historical accuracy of the game is allowed in battlefield 5<br>Now that EA is so eloquent about this, what about the game itself? In the early stage of selling, the game almost went online in a “preemptive experience” manner. At first, only Britain and Germany were involved, and the content was extremely scarce. EA said that the follow-up content would be updated at the time in the historical records, which is called “the tide of war”. In fact, this is the fake of the second explosion table designed by EA to slow down the update speed of the game and leave a step for itself Install. The actual experience and quality of the game are OK, and the rhythm and design feel of the game are ideal. However, the content of the game is too few, and the constant emergence of bugs has a great impact on the experience of the game, and the so-called “wave of war” is just like squeezing toothpaste.<br>It has been nearly a year since the game was updated. Although there is a “flaming storm” model called “the most gorgeous escape in history”, the “chicken eating” craze has subsided by that time. Many people are already tired of aesthetic appreciation. After all, the core content is not good, and these additional content is not good No matter how gorgeous it is, it won’t help.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/We have become the most hated of each other, and call of duty is becoming battlefield/57ec050edce5434392edaf415209c508.jpg" alt="We have become the most hated of each other, and call of duty is becoming battlefield"><br>Publicity map of “fire storm” mode</p>
<p>#Come back?<br>It is undeniable that the call of Duty series is almost equal to Japan’s “the brave fight against the dragon” in the minds of European and American players, which can be called a national FPS game. Many works have reached tens of millions of sales, dominating the sales list of European and American host market for many years in a row. Although the word-of-mouth is not good in the player group, the players should buy or will buy. From the second generation of the series, in order to increase the life and playability of the game, the series has joined the mode of multi player battle. With the passage of time, the heat of multi player battle has gradually surpassed that of single player battle. Even when the previous generation of the work “black action 4” directly eliminated single player battle and made a pure battle game.<br>For a long time, the multiplayer mode of the call of Duty series has been a small map fast-paced street battle. Compared with the battlefield series, there are obvious differences in the battle rhythm and playing methods, which also leads to mutual contempt between the two sides. However, the new work now will directly upgrade the battlefield scale to a higher level than battlefield, which is absolutely true for developers It’s a bold attempt, but for players, it’s hard to avoid some bottomless.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/We have become the most hated of each other, and call of duty is becoming battlefield/8a6835b47acc4ee2b6be8c2cae0c596e.jpg" alt="We have become the most hated of each other, and call of duty is becoming battlefield"><br>The picture of multi person mode in the restart edition of modern war<br>After the magnificent ending of the trilogy of modern war, the background of the call of Duty series has always been jumping in different periods, sometimes falling back to the Vietnam War in the Second World War, sometimes flying back to the near future and even the future, only one ghost has adopted the modern background. The author doesn’t need to elaborate on how popular the trilogy of modern war is. Fans of this series hope for and don’t want to have new works. After all, it’s a pity that this hot series ends like this, but the story of the trilogy has been completed. Players are afraid that activism will try to squeeze the IP value and smash the signboard.<br>In terms of mobile TV, it has come up with but dare not come out of this series. However, the voice of this series is really high, and it is inevitable that the future background will be used for many years. In order not to offend people but also to ensure the quality of the game, mobile TV has chosen to restart IP and keep the original settings to create a new story, so that both old and new players All of them can be readily accepted.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/We have become the most hated of each other, and call of duty is becoming battlefield/625e649be321484d8e2cfb741bcfa45c.jpg" alt="We have become the most hated of each other, and call of duty is becoming battlefield"><br>This ghost is not the ghost</p>
<p>#Conclusion<br>At last, the new action video is willing to replace the new engine. After all, more than ten old engines have been repaired, which is also the most criticized point of the players. After the change of the new engine, there has been obvious progress in both the picture performance and the sound effect performance. The 50v50 mode to be launched this time is to retain the original core mode and the additional content beyond the system mechanism, and meet the needs of different players in different ways.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/We have become the most hated of each other, and call of duty is becoming battlefield/2498a3c977394f0daf38a117a9379e17.jpg" alt="We have become the most hated of each other, and call of duty is becoming battlefield"><br>Ironically, in this year’s update, “battlefield 5” added 5v5 small-scale operations, but now the scale of “call of duty”, which has always been the main small-scale operation, has suddenly surpassed the scale of “battlefield”. The two originally despised each other, but now it is about to become the most hated look on the other side. However, this does not mean that the use of large-scale “call of duty” must be the same as that of “battlefield”. At least it seems that the fans of the series still give positive feedback on the new mode at present, but what is the actual experience? It is necessary to wait for the actual sale of the game before commenting.</p>
