        <p>In November last year, a game producer named tobyfox finally updated his twitter after a long silence, and this is more than a few. He said to his friends who followed him: “please come back in 24 hours, and I want to share a good thing that you will be interested in.” 24 hours later, tobyfox updated the news as scheduled, and released a game called deltarune (triangle Rune) to the outside world, and released the demo of the game, which exploded the whole game circle in an instant.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Who said that good games can't be made without big production What kind of magic does under the legend contain/32fdf6c6aa02411eb4f9ccfeb6cbaef8.jpg" alt="Who said that good games can&#39;t be made without big production What kind of magic does under the legend contain"><br>This game is not so well made. It’s just a pixel style RPG game, but it has aroused the cheers of many players. Curious people will ask, why can such a game arouse such a strong response of players? It’s not surprising that the game producer, Toby fox, launched a popular masterpiece four years ago, called “underground”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Who said that good games can't be made without big production What kind of magic does under the legend contain/789cb9f58374495f95e2e6469a9aa52d.jpg" alt="Who said that good games can&#39;t be made without big production What kind of magic does under the legend contain"></p>
<h1 id="follow-the-feeling"><a href="#follow-the-feeling" class="headerlink" title="follow the feeling"></a>follow the feeling</h1><p>As early as 1994, edge, a British magazine, published such a review. The reviewed game work was the classic FPS game “destroyer”, which was popular at that time. The editor of the magazine praised the operating system and strong screen performance of the game in the review, but denied the depth and connotation of the game. After all, “destroyer” is a pure shooting game There is no plot or depth, just turn all the moving things in front of you. “If you can communicate with those monsters, maybe you can make friends with them. That’s so interesting,” the editor said As soon as the comments were made, they triggered discussion in the game circle, and everyone laughed at the editor. Can you imagine that? In an age when playing games is just for fun, there are people who want to make friends with enemies. More than 20 years later, the game producer named tobyfox actually made this concept into a game. This time, he was not ridiculed, but admired and praised by many players.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Who said that good games can't be made without big production What kind of magic does under the legend contain/e71b6f77c2014dc19bd56f728199ab1a.jpg" alt="Who said that good games can&#39;t be made without big production What kind of magic does under the legend contain"><br>Edge original<br>In short, Toby wanted to make a dialogue program at first, but when he was doing it, he felt that he could add a combat system to it. Adding a combat system meant that he could have characters, scenes and plots. The more he did it, the more it looked like a game. That’s why “under the legend” is so unique. Because it’s not developed as a game, there are so many Different from video games. In Toby’s cognition, he has been exposed to many different types of video games with different styles. Since he intends to make a game, he will put together all the excellent settings of his favorite interesting games to make a work that can subvert people’s cognition.<br>After all, “under the legend” is just a turn RPG game, but it can pass the customs without any blame or upgrade, and the screen and UI of the game, even the game menu, are extremely simple, even the game background and world view are very old-fashioned. However, no one knows whether the design is the author’s intention, and these seemingly disdainful contents instead become The camouflage of the game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Who said that good games can't be made without big production What kind of magic does under the legend contain/c947afc8adfc44268f4b7537f4679ec3.jpg" alt="Who said that good games can&#39;t be made without big production What kind of magic does under the legend contain"><br>Although the picture of “under the legend” is simple and crude, it is not so bad</p>
<p>#Dialogue with monsters<br>Just mentioned that the game can not even kill a monster without upgrading to a level. Of course, there are also settings that can fight. You can also kill all monsters as a brave man to kill for the people. However, the design of “can not kill a monster” completely subverts the logical thinking of the whole play. In the game, the player plays a human who slips into the monster world from the human world. The goal is to find a way to return to the human world. Your adventure starts from this. It seems that this is a more conventional development.<br>The beginning of the game has briefly introduced the background of the game: humans and monsters once ruled the world together, but for some reasons, there was a war between the two sides, and finally humans won the victory, and the monsters were sealed underground. If you look closely, the game doesn’t say that the two sides have a war for any reason, which means that one of them must have an idea that they don’t belong to the group, but they don’t tell you who the other side is. They just tell you that human beings have defeated monsters and sealed them underground, giving you the illusion that “human beings are just, monsters must be evil” What if we reverse the whole thinking? What if it’s humans who are evil and monsters who are passive?<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Who said that good games can't be made without big production What kind of magic does under the legend contain/47293ba5e48e495bb7c82302d11ba591.jpg" alt="Who said that good games can&#39;t be made without big production What kind of magic does under the legend contain"><br>With this unusual thinking, the story and play method of the whole “under the legend” is formed. In short, it is not necessary to think in accordance with common sense. In the whole game and the traditional Japanese RPG game, you can try to interact with monsters who want to attack you, so as to reduce their hostility to you, and use mercy to monsters when the time is right, so as to end the fight of the game. If the player doesn’t want to fight but doesn’t want to be hurt, the game also introduces a barrage system similar to “Oriental project”. As long as the enemy evades the attack from the enemy in the turn, the damage can be avoided. It’s called “the enemy who bends without fighting”. When you put down your prejudice and try to contact with these monsters, you will even find that these monsters are not only harmless to humans and animals, but even richer than human emotions.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Who said that good games can't be made without big production What kind of magic does under the legend contain/9615a75143f748b1b5134cd095cd9a31.jpg" alt="Who said that good games can&#39;t be made without big production What kind of magic does under the legend contain"><br>Characters with distinct personalities are hard to forget once they play</p>
<p>#Take everything into consideration<br>To a great extent, the design of “under the legend” refers to the classic RPG game “mother” in Nintendo’s early years. The latter is also a work that doesn’t play according to the routine. As for how many elements in “mother” are paid homage to, even the author himself can’t say. After many players have played this work, the first feeling is usually not how novel the design and ideas of this game are, but that they feel like they have been played by the game.<br>Many bridge sections in the game give the players a feeling that the game itself wants to break the dimension wall and talk directly with the players off the screen. Generally, we call this setting “meta”. For example, if the player kills a key NPC, and then the reader returns to the beginning of the battle, there will often be some different plots from the first experience. Due to the unique combat system, the process of the game is divided into several routes. If the players are almost crazy to kill in the game, they will even be automatically deleted by the game, giving the players a sense of substitution of “this is a real world”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Who said that good games can't be made without big production What kind of magic does under the legend contain/843bd85a92cd4bc287d9f2dafc66a809.jpg" alt="Who said that good games can&#39;t be made without big production What kind of magic does under the legend contain"><br>Game mother game screen<br>The most brilliant design for the author is interactivity. The author seems to take every action that a player can take into account in every bridge section, so that every action of the player can get feedback. For example, if you don’t have space in your backpack, if you choose to buy a hot dog, the boss will put the hot dog on your head because you don’t have space; or if you choose to discard or use the gifts or props given by NPC, you will also be criticized and questioned by NPC. Strictly speaking, the game enriches the interaction details of the game to the greatest extent. The last time I felt this feeling was in the classic American RPG game “gate of Bode”. Players can decide how to carry out the task by themselves, while “under the legend” added “feedback” to this possibility, so as to improve the game’s sense of substitution more recently.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Who said that good games can't be made without big production What kind of magic does under the legend contain/011c447776024e6cbd71487237dc9174.jpg" alt="Who said that good games can&#39;t be made without big production What kind of magic does under the legend contain"><br>Every player’s choice in the game is not meaningless</p>
<p>#Conclusion<br>Toby creates the game’s sense of substitution for the players to the greatest extent in “under the legend”. The purpose is to encourage the players to choose the most peaceful one among the numerous game routes, so as to give the players a sense of “they are the real existence of the general”, and all kinds of unique settings and systems are all in this direction, but at the same time, Toby does not want to pass this way In this way, the freedom of players is restricted, and the playing methods and systems of regular games are added. If we integrate all these design ideas together, we can easily find that the author wants to express an idea of subverting the traditional game design ideas.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Who said that good games can't be made without big production What kind of magic does under the legend contain/7cbb85c9deb84d71a5916aea57f2e351.jpg" alt="Who said that good games can&#39;t be made without big production What kind of magic does under the legend contain"><br>The author’s Avatar in the game is a dog<br>Is the game flawed? Of course, there are, but the highlights of the game will cover the shortcomings of the game tightly. At first, the game began crowdfunding in KickStarter, with a goal of only $5000. However, relying on the author’s unique ideas, the game raised nearly ten times more money than the goal. However, compared with many 3A high-cost masterpieces, the cost of “under the legend” is still a small problem. Under such conditions, Toby still stepped on a number of 3A games through the quality of the game itself, and drew a ear of melon severely. There was no high-quality painting, no big production, but he still made the highest praise rate of “under the legend” until now. As for Toby’s new work “triangle Rune”, the official version of which is suitable for launch, the author has no idea. Whether this new work can reproduce the dazzling achievements of “under the legend”, please wait and see.</p>
