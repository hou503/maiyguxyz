    <content><![CDATA[<p>In the late 1980s, it was the era of arcades and home games. When talking about the game works of that period, many post-90s or post-80s would mention classic works such as Super Mario and Douro. At that time, except Nintendo, Konami was the most popular company. “Red fortress”, “green Legion” and just mentioned “soul battle” and many other excellent works of war themes are all from the hands of kolomei, and become irreplaceable classics in the minds of players.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/32 years of classic shooting IP destroyed, it's really your Konami/5e7bdf5b84e94111b3d42dd76e2995c0.jpg" alt="32 years of classic shooting IP destroyed, it&#39;s really your Konami"><br>After more than 30 years, today’s cologne has long been different from the scenery of that time, but “the battle of souls” has lived to the present with the changes of the times. At the E3 game exhibition held in June this year, Cologne released the latest work of “soul fighter” series, RC alliance, and announced that it would be released in just three months. Many people are excited just to see the name of “soul duel” and say they must pay for it. But no one expected that this orthodox sequel, which was personally operated by “father of soul duel”, might have become one of the worst works of this generation.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/32 years of classic shooting IP destroyed, it's really your Konami/8e696869c20342b5af9628c0907a93c7.jpg" alt="32 years of classic shooting IP destroyed, it&#39;s really your Konami"></p>
<h1 id="wrong-board"><a href="#wrong-board" class="headerlink" title="wrong board?"></a>wrong board?</h1><p>Take the PS4 platform as an example. So far, there are 20 media that have scored for “soul fighter: RC League”, while only one media has given a positive score. The others either linger on the passing line or fail completely. What’s worth mentioning is that most of the media that give the evaluation for the game are self-supporting small media, few of which are internationally renowned media. Among them, ign has the highest status, but they only give a four point (10 out of 10) evaluation for the game, and they say that this is the worst work in the history of soul duel series. In the view of IGN, if Cologne doesn’t name the game “soul duel”, no one will think it’s a “soul duel” game. It’s enough to disappoint every fan who loves this series. He abandoned the most iconic play method of “soul duel”, but failed to achieve its original production height or even worse. There’s no doubt that Cologne Le Mei wasted a chance to polish the golden signboard of “the battle of souls”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/32 years of classic shooting IP destroyed, it's really your Konami/4a62a3db3cdb4221bd50226622c8a41c.jpg" alt="32 years of classic shooting IP destroyed, it&#39;s really your Konami"><br>In “RC alliance”, the biggest change is that the game style has changed from the original horizontal action shooting to the 3D action shooting of the overlooking angle, but it is not always the overlooking angle, and there is often a switch between the perspective of crossing the shoulder and the perspective of chasing the back, which can not be controlled by the players completely, and the game itself will make the change according to the progress of the checkpoint Adjustment. The biggest drawback of this design is that the perspective does not change with the player’s consciousness. It is very easy to confuse the player, and sometimes it is blocked by the objects in the scene, which greatly affects the play. Players who have played the old version should know that one of the core contents of the previous game is to avoid the enemy’s attack, so jumping and crawling are two very important operations. In this work, a new “dodge” action without consumption and cooling is added, which can not only dodge the attack, but also stun the enemy, which makes the jumping action completely unavailable except for crossing obstacles Purpose. For the first time, the image quality and character setting of the game are slightly behind the times. It’s not like a 2019 shooting game at all.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/32 years of classic shooting IP destroyed, it's really your Konami/3588a788c02240c3ae2aa22fcdc528f0.jpg" alt="32 years of classic shooting IP destroyed, it&#39;s really your Konami"><br>Reform of<br>In the memory of many players, it is estimated that the most impressive one is the first generation of “soul Douluo” and the sequel “super soul Douluo” (also known as “soul Douluo 2”) on the red and white computer in the early years. In fact, in the next many years, “soul Douluo” has been trying to push out new works, and has tried to launch a 3-D perspective shooting before long, but since PC After the rise of the game market, except for some series fans, there are not many players who only log in to the console and the handheld platform. However, although the popularity of this series has gradually declined, the new work has been persistently launched, and even the mobile game “soul fighter: back”, which was launched in cooperation with Tencent later, although it reveals a crude atmosphere from its bones, the popularity is still obvious. This gives keleme confidence, and it’s just that other manufacturers are also launching a collection of classic games of various duplicating versions. It seems that it’s a trend to show the old IP in the industry.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/32 years of classic shooting IP destroyed, it's really your Konami/fabfe6ee4cfc4b49b516ebe2651d5251.jpg" alt="32 years of classic shooting IP destroyed, it&#39;s really your Konami"><br>“The father of the battle of souls”<br>In fact, as a work adapted from the sci-fi film alien, the series has a high popularity in Europe and the United States in view of the influence of the film. To a large extent, it is not only because of the high quality of the game itself, but also because it complements the film. And in Asia, even if everyone knows the name of “Doula”, but not many people hold the authentic game card tape, let alone who knows what kind of story “Doula” tells. These players only know that the game is fun to play, and it’s better to cooperate online with small partners. Coleman also knows how many sales of these works it owns, and always hopes to have a chance to develop the market in Asia. However, due to the bad review of “soul fighter: back”, the IP reputation has declined. At this year’s Dongjing video game exhibition, the participating Coleman uses a quarter of its own area to publicize “RC alliance” Biography, it can be seen that Cologne attaches great importance to this work, but perhaps they didn’t expect that the current players no longer eat their original set.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/32 years of classic shooting IP destroyed, it's really your Konami/cbce2f7b7b364ad7bafc7e7cc885de9c.jpg" alt="32 years of classic shooting IP destroyed, it&#39;s really your Konami"><br>Keleme is very familiar with current affairs and has added many new elements to RC alliance, such as multiple optional roles, weapon configuration and accessories selection, upgrading from two person online to online four person online, and even 4v4 PVP content. The overall game style is still the familiar B-movie style of the 1990s, but the times are changing, and people’s tastes and aesthetics are also changing, because of the design theory The stereotype of reading makes it difficult for this game to enter the stage of elegance at present. If it is not true love fans, even in other fields, this style is no longer popular.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/32 years of classic shooting IP destroyed, it's really your Konami/6095102272aa46ef924a673f4667e07b.jpg" alt="32 years of classic shooting IP destroyed, it&#39;s really your Konami"><br>    concluding remarks<br>The reason why the “soul fighting” in the early years can become a classic in the minds of millions of people is that it is simple and direct, playing addictive, and online with friends more tests the cooperation ability of two people, even if it is “mutual harm” is also fun. For an IP that has been more than 30 years old, it’s really difficult to get a place in this efficient fast food era. If you can’t follow the rules and regulations to ensure that the original game experience pays homage to the classic, you can only choose to keep up with the times for a long time, and use the design and production of the latest trend to get the recognition of the players. But maybe even if this generation of “RC League” is reviled, there are still some players who will enjoy it. Don’t think it’s because they don’t know how to appreciate it. Maybe it’s just because there is a little content in the game that brings them the fun they want.</p>

    <title>A good movie doesn&#39;t mean a good game. How does James Bond 007 stink</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>There are three famous secret agents in the game world, one is the strongest mercenary “snake” from the “alloy equipment” series, the other is Sam Fisher from the “cell division” series, and the last one is Agent 47 (Agent 47) from the “killer” series. The three agents had been fighting each other in the past years, but now they have already gone their separate ways. The sequels of alloy equipment and cell division have become the lifetimes, while killer has chosen a different path from the former. As we all know, the “four kings” always have five people, and the three agents must have a “fourth person”, and the fourth monologue fame is certainly better than the former, but as for the game works, it’s hard to say.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A good movie doesn't mean a good game.

His black suit and silencing pistol are his symbols. He is vigorous and has outstanding shooting skills. He holds all kinds of novel equipment to play the enemy between the hands and the thighs. He is not only an excellent agent, but also a charming gentleman. He is always accompanied by beautiful women. Some people may say, “are you sure you didn’t introduce 47 again?” Of course not. He’s British agent James Bond, and if you’re not familiar with the name, he has a more widely known code name 007.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A good movie doesn't mean a good game.

Out of fear of marriage life, he created this work based on his own prototype. The first work of 007, Casino Royale, was published in 1953. Because of its novel and wonderful story, it soon became a success. Many of the black technology equipment in the story have prototypes in reality. The protagonist’s name “James Bond” comes from the author of a book called birds of the West Indies, and the character’s design is completely based on Ian’s own life experience and preferences. This mysterious agent called “perfect type man” has enough charm to make all men jealous and all women crazy. With the great sale of the novel, the image of “007” began to be known by more and more people.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A good movie doesn't mean a good game. How does James Bond 007 stink/3e8c0f1591a94d018eedc6274f09404b.jpg" alt="A good movie doesn&#39;t mean a good game. How does James Bond 007 stink"><br>Ian Fleming, father of 007<br>The story of 007 is excellent enough to make a wonderful movie. In 1962, the first film of 007 series, Dr. no, was released and became popular all over the world, and the name of James Bond became more and more popular. Unfortunately, two years after the movie was released, Ian Fleming, the original author, died of a heart attack. In his lifetime, he completed the last 007 work “the golden gun man”, but the 007 series did not end his story. Later, John Gardner (who has died) and Raymond Benson took over the writing of subsequent works and screenplays. Up to now, there are 14 novels in 007 series, and 26 films (two autobiographies). And next year, its 25th orthodox work bond 25 will be ushered in, which can be said to be a classic legend that really accompanies a generation.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A good movie doesn't mean a good game.

<h1 id="hard-won-glory"><a href="#hard-won-glory" class="headerlink" title="hard won glory"></a>hard won glory</h1><p>Sports cars, beauties, black technology equipment and perfect men’s secret agents are all used to stir up the men’s hormones. Just ask which man doesn’t want to be a “successful man” like James Bond. Based on this idea, the adapted play of 007 series is run to try to satisfy the little wish of the male audience. Coincidentally, “007” series is about to usher in his 25th work, and “007” series adaptation game is also a good 25. The first work of the series is James Bond 007, a horizontal shooting game that landed on yadali 2600 platform in 1983. However, the quality of the game is not satisfactory. Can you imagine a 007 game with the full name of James Bond not appearing except for the start screen? As a result, the game did not cause as much sensation as the movie or novel, and the sales volume was also very poor.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A good movie doesn't mean a good game. How does James Bond 007 stink/6c8bc636fd3440c4a7abd92fdb9e826a.jpg" alt="A good movie doesn&#39;t mean a good game. How does James Bond 007 stink"><br>James Bond 007 game screen, not to say who knows this is 007 game<br>What is puzzling is that 007 is so easy to make into the theme of the game, but it has not been able to produce a satisfactory work. The works over the years are either of poor quality or quite different from the story of 007. In this way, it has come to the age of 3D games. Nintendo launched its own sub era console N64. At first, the British developer rare planned to make a 2D horizontal scroll game 007 for the N64. At that time, when the movie golden eye was in full swing, it is not surprising that the idea of a game came out. Later, at the suggestion of game development director Martin Hollis, they redesigned golden eye into an FPS game to fully adapt to the features and functions of N64. To put it in normal times, people will certainly take it for granted that this is another adaptation game, but this time, rare’s unusual intention for this adaptation game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A good movie doesn't mean a good game. How does James Bond 007 stink/0e2bc0b390a54890b44b34e196c3e730.jpg" alt="A good movie doesn&#39;t mean a good game. How does James Bond 007 stink"><br>N64 golden eye cover<br>According to the characteristics of N64, rare specially designed a set of FPS operation mode belonging to the handle, and for the first time introduced the stealth and part injury (i.e. head burst or kick) system in the FPS game, making the game experience more like controlling an agent than a man with developed limbs and simple mind. A large number of scenes in the movie are restored in the game, and the game has a more sense of substitution under the support of FPS. In order to achieve this effect, the development team also specially went to the shooting set of golden eye to collect a large number of materials. The birth of 007 golden eye has changed people’s cognition of FPS game, breaking the magic spell of “host platform is FPS forbidden area”, and the media have made high marks for it. The sales volume of the game in the United States alone has soared 5 million sets, and up to now, it has sold more than 8 million sets. As a 007 game, it has finally become a milestone in FPS history Monumental work.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A good movie doesn't mean a good game.

How does James Bond 007 stink"><br>“Golden eye” game screen, in 1997 has been quite excellent</p>
<h1 id="“agent”-is-gone-forever"><a href="#“agent”-is-gone-forever" class="headerlink" title="“agent” is gone forever"></a>“agent” is gone forever</h1><p>However, the rise of the handsome agent in the game world seems to be over. After the explosion of 007 golden eye, the American manufacturer EA felt that the IP was profitable and paid a lot of money to buy all the production rights and distribution rights of the subsequent 007 games from MGM film company. At that time, EA was still in the exploration stage of game adaptation. Although it tried its best to rely on the golden eye and try to restore the plot and scene of the game, it still had more than enough effort in the design of system and operation. Two successive works suffered sudden death, once making 007, the IP, return to the posture before golden eye. EA thinks that if it goes on like this, IP adaptation will inevitably be limited in production, which will affect the consistency and experience of the game to a large extent. Therefore, EA plans not to use the original plot to make adaptation games, but to create original game works based on basic settings.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A good movie doesn't mean a good game. How does James Bond 007 stink/4aab29816a244daf946fb487e6de6d49.jpg" alt="A good movie doesn&#39;t mean a good game. How does James Bond 007 stink"><br>007: after tomorrow<br>The follow-up works 007: agent of the line of fire and 007: night fire have improved in all aspects after breaking away from the shackles of the movie plot, and the evaluation of the game has gradually recovered, while the later released 007: who is competing with the leader is the masterpiece of this IP in the hands of EA, regardless of whether it is the best in the plot or in the performance of music and painting, and this work should also be James Bond’s actor, Pierce Brosnan, made his last appearance in the game.<br>Later, due to EA’s own reasons, MGM took back the IP of 007 and gave it to Activision. In the eyes of Activision at that time, its call of duty (COD) series was almost equal to the shooting games of that period. When Activision got the IP of 007, it also made adaptation games like cod. But unlike cod, the game’s brilliance and game experience were far inferior to cod series, and its playing method was cod series series Like linear level and script performance.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A good movie doesn't mean a good game. How does James Bond 007 stink/ec53d6de0c5d420a84135e127e30d7f5.jpg" alt="A good movie doesn&#39;t mean a good game. How does James Bond 007 stink"><br>Who will fight for the front is another kind of magnificent ending of Bruce South<br>Activision has successively launched three works for the 007 series, and the protagonist has been replaced by the current 007 actor Daniel Craig. First, 007: quantum crisis, which spans two movie scenarios, was criticized because it is too similar to and far inferior to the COD series. However, the subsequent 007: Bloodstone has become a third person stealth The game, however, does not have the feeling that 007 is an agent or a spy. It is said that 007 is not of the right bloodline. Later, on the 50th anniversary of 007 series, 007: Legend, which spans six movie plots, was launched at one go. However, although it is playing the emotion card, all 007 is played by Daniel alone. In addition to the plot of the biggest selling point, the whole game It’s all about cod.<br>Before that, you didn’t think quantum crisis is like cod, but it’s not as good as cod. This time, just make cod directly. What do you say? It’s true that this memorable work is also remembered by people, but it’s just rotten. The average score of the media is only 26 (full score of 100).<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A good movie doesn't mean a good game. How does James Bond 007 stink/d5e1093d0c69410bbd18989bbe9f0c80.jpg" alt="A good movie doesn&#39;t mean a good game. How does James Bond 007 stink"><br>007: Legend game screen, are you sure this is not cod6?<br>    concluding remarks<br>Since then, the author has never seen the 007 series of game works. Activision even took the three works they had sold off the platform, as if it wanted to erase the traces of these games. However, the death of the game did not affect the popularity of the movie and bond’s status in the hearts of fans. After all, Activision is not race. Their main purpose of playing games is to earn money, while race is to make games with the attitude of wanting to be recognized by the players, and the final outcome of the two is obvious, a famous history, a legacy. The story of bond fighting in the game circle has come to an end for a while. It is also unknown whether there will be any new works in the future. But it is undeniable that the era of bond seems to be really coming to an end. I hope that it can draw a perfect sentence for us at the end of life.</p>

    <title>A radiation 76, contracted players to laugh for a whole year</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/A%20radiation%2076,%20contracted%20players%20to%20laugh%20for%20a%20whole%20year/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Speaking of the biggest thunder work in 2018, the service-oriented game “radiation 76” not produced by Bethesda, if the players who pay attention to the game at the first time should know that the game suffered a sudden death in the first round, the reputation of media players collapsed, and the quality of the game itself can only be described as “disaster”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A radiation 76, contracted players to laugh for a whole year/f341bccecff54171b99503fe2ea334b8.jpg" alt="A radiation 76, contracted players to laugh for a whole year"><br>It has been nearly a year since the release of radiation 76. During this period, the negative news about community B and radiation 76 will appear almost every other time. It seems that when we are about to forget their “operation of fans”, he will always jump out and brush another wave of existence. The good reputation that B club painstakingly built seems to collapse in a flash, and in the next period of time, it will always bring new jokes to the melon eaters. Throughout the history of the development of video games, no game manufacturer can be as funny as B club.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A radiation 76, contracted players to laugh for a whole year/f395836dfc964856bbf9955b836ee0f8.jpg" alt="A radiation 76, contracted players to laugh for a whole year"></p>
<h1 id="Fallout-1st"><a href="#Fallout-1st" class="headerlink" title="Fallout 1st"></a>Fallout 1st</h1><p>Here’s a brief explanation of the game mechanism of radiation 76. The online mode rules of radiation 76 are the same as those of other multiplayer online survival online games. However, in the mechanism of multiplayer online, it’s similar to the online mode of gta5. Multiple players can live on the same map, and each server can accommodate multiple such maps (or battle situations). Players only If you want to be in the same situation, you can attack other players at will on this map. In this case, it is inevitable that some players who want to play the game seriously will be affected by the players who want to do damage sincerely, so as to form a disorderly and murderous game environment. Therefore, in order to get a good game experience, we just want to kill monsters online with our little friends easily. A considerable number of players have been petitioning B club to launch the service of private server.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A radiation 76, contracted players to laugh for a whole year/8da3e879a49d4ea79321bf438389be2b.jpg" alt="A radiation 76, contracted players to laugh for a whole year"><br>Subscribe to service content<br>On October 24 this year, Club B launched a new subscription service for radiation 76, which was available for players to purchase on the day of release and named “fallout 1st”. Fallout 1st is similar to the senior member pass in other games. With it, you can get the qualification to open the private server, enjoy a carefree game environment, and also get a series of other special benefits, such as infinite space “break down box”, extra discounts and currency subsidies for stores, extra fast travel points, etc. For such a set of services, the monthly subscription fee is $12.99 (about 92rmb), or $99.99 a year (about 706rmb). This price is quite expensive for a subscription service. Considering that the cost of private service is indeed high, some people don’t care about that money and pay out their money, but they find that this service is also like the game of agency B Bug is heavy.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A radiation 76, contracted players to laugh for a whole year/414a342c801940ffa4d4912837e6140d.jpg" alt="A radiation 76, contracted players to laugh for a whole year"><br>Netizen makes stem map<br>First of all, although the private server is only open to friends, it is open to everyone in the player’s friends list. You don’t need to serve the host’s invitation to enter or leave at will. For those players with many strangers in the friends list, “private server” has the same five characters. Secondly, the world created by players seems to have been swept by players. The booty box has been opened, and many NPCs have died for unknown reasons. The material storage box that claims to have unlimited capacity is really “infinite capacity”, and everything put in it will disappear for no reason. It is indeed a “decomposition box” worthy of its name. However, these are just the most influential bugs. There are more bugs that are not mentioned here. What players pay so much money for is a more intimate game experience. The so-called “paying for the crime” is probably the feeling.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A radiation 76, contracted players to laugh for a whole year/61295b6d1ce843eb9f212b2e445628be.jpg" alt="A radiation 76, contracted players to laugh for a whole year"><br>A box worthy of name</p>
<p>#Disaster pr<br>“Radiation 76” suffered a setback at the beginning, so in order to save a little situation, the game directly started to promote at a discount of 70% or 60% only one week after it went on the market. The original price of the game was about 400 RMB, and even 300% of the discount was not achieved. Obviously, this is enough to make those players who bought the game at the original price in advance or in the first round lose blood In response to this, Club B’s customer service provided a subsidy of 500 yuan (about $5) to those players who bought the game at the original price, and this subsidy still needs to be offered by the customer service. More and more people choose to refund, but because the platform where the game is launched is to log in, in addition to the host computer, bethesda.net, so there will be some trouble in the refund process. The first person may have a chance to succeed in the refund, and as more and more people refund, club B suddenly changed the refund policy: as long as the game has been downloaded, there is no refund. This is to annoy a group of players who buy the game, complain and report, and even some people go to the headquarters of B club to ask for a statement. B club can’t resist the anger of the players, so they have to pay back unconditionally and in full.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A radiation 76, contracted players to laugh for a whole year/f2a351cb5a824fb6ad78b32c74bca692.jpg" alt="A radiation 76, contracted players to laugh for a whole year"><br>It’s reasonable to give players a refund, and then slowly repair the content of the game, which should be over, but in addition to the game itself, agency B has a moth in other places besides the game this time: at the end of November 2018, the collection game launched when radiation 76 was released was finally sent to the players. The most attractive gift of this collection is one A power armored helmet is also attached with a canvas bag that looks very delicate and is used to hold the helmet. When players receive the goods, they find that the canvas bag is replaced by a very cheap nylon bag at a glance. The reason given by the customer service of social B is that “due to the lack of materials, the nylon bag is replaced, but this does not affect your enjoyment of this product, which is the most we have ever made Great collection. “ At that time, all the players who bought the pawnbroking version exploded again. However, community B responded to compensate each player who bought the pawnbroking version of the game with 500 atomic coins.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A radiation 76, contracted players to laugh for a whole year/b8a9276e1c9d4ee59037eb082d10e3d7.jpg" alt="A radiation 76, contracted players to laugh for a whole year"><br>Contents of the collection<br>You should know that the price of this collection version is as high as $200, and 500 atomic coins are only equivalent to $5. Moreover, in radiation 76, 500 atomic coins can also buy low-cost skin or decorations that no one will buy. Obviously, this is another bleeding trade. How can players be dismissed like this? What’s more, the media participating in the press conference of Club B even get better free canvas bags than the collection version, so the two sides start to curse again. Club B is really out of temper, and finally decides to let the players who intend to exchange canvas bags register on the corresponding website, and they will send the agreed canvas bags to the players.<br>But it’s just such a simple job that club B can still have problems: every player who goes to register can see the personal information filled in by other players on that registration website, including address, contact information, bank card number, etc., which undoubtedly reveals the content that should be kept secret. Although Club B has repaired the loophole in an emergency, it is undoubtedly a negative part of club B News, even many media have said no words, a canvas bag has let them write so many news.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A radiation 76, contracted players to laugh for a whole year/df60c1c8a9794a51a3f200d9b022969d.jpg" alt="A radiation 76, contracted players to laugh for a whole year"><br>Some players make canvas bags into mod and put them into the game to mock Club B<br>    concluding remarks<br>There are also many ironic news about radiation 76. For example, the fabric inside the complimentary helmet may cause respiratory tract bacterial infection, and Club B can only recall it urgently; players who use mod for the game will be labeled as cheating, and if they need to unseal it, they need to write a review to club B; the surrounding rum launched in cooperation with the winery is not only expensive, but also of poor quality and package The package was supposed to be the same as in the game and turned into a plastic shell wrapped glass bottle.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A radiation 76, contracted players to laugh for a whole year/74c80ee6454c4f7ab3a33f579d1b60ea.jpg" alt="A radiation 76, contracted players to laugh for a whole year"><br>The price is $80. Most players only want bottles<br>Not to mention how the game itself has been updated after this year. At least in this year, we saw all kinds of jokes caused by B club’s carelessness. As we all know, B club has produced the masterpiece of “ancient scroll 5”, which is the level of a 3A overseas factory, but now he makes all kinds of appearances like a clown. All these are attributed to the launch of “radiation 76”, which is not supposed to be launched. It is estimated that B club has been deeply hit by these successive events. I hope he can We can correct our problems as soon as possible and get on the right track. After all, there are so many people waiting for the release of ancient scroll 6 and starry sky.</p>

    <title>A game series with 11 years of history, how to make generations of bad reviews and continue to be new</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/A%20game%20series%20with%2011%20years%20of%20history,%20how%20to%20make%20generations%20of%20bad%20reviews%20and%20continue%20to%20be%20new/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to polish game companies, it’s estimated that most of the players will think of cdpr as a “donkey” for the first time. With its well-made “Wizard” series, straightforward development concept and attentive attitude to serve the players, not only the reputation of the game is surprisingly high, but also the reputation of the company is surprisingly good in the industry, and such game manufacturers even put in the world There are also very few games in the market. A small number of players may know that an independent game company named 11bit has many well received independent game masterpieces such as ice age and this is my war.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A game series with 11 years of history, how to make generations of bad reviews and continue to be new/619a270c5ac2442ab1d95c62b9f923a4.jpg" alt="A game series with 11 years of history, how to make generations of bad reviews and continue to be new"><br>There is such a game company, which was founded almost at the same time as cdpr, and is also of Polish origin. Up to now, the number of games is more than 100, but it is amazing that most of their game evaluations are almost failed, which is called “the worst game company in Europe”. This company is called City Interactive (hereinafter referred to as CI) As the representative of “Sniper: Ghost fighter”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A game series with 11 years of history, how to make generations of bad reviews and continue to be new/c6b0cee290e64ee88abd042aaf6940ed.jpg" alt="A game series with 11 years of history, how to make generations of bad reviews and continue to be new"></p>
<h1 id="sudden-death-at-the-beginning"><a href="#sudden-death-at-the-beginning" class="headerlink" title="sudden death at the beginning"></a>sudden death at the beginning</h1><p>As early as August 2018, Sniper: Ghost fighter released a new work, and determined the actual content of the game at this year’s E3 game exhibition, called Sniper: Ghost fighter contract. In fact, this is the fourth generation of this series. It’s nine years since the first generation of this series was released. For players who haven’t been in touch with this series, just look at the name. They should know that this is a shooting game with the selling point of playing a sniper. Players play a sniper who has experienced many battles in the game and go to all kinds of places alone This kind of scene carries out various sniping tasks. It seems that there are not many styles in the whole game market. However, the name is easy to be confused by the players and the French Ubisoft’s “ghost action” series. I don’t know what kind of works are there in this series.<br>In fact, there is also a reason for this. It’s the same tactical shooting game with the modern background and the core of potential behavior. Obviously, the reputation of sniper series is much lower than that of ghost action series. When it comes to potential sniper games, it’s estimated that most players will think of the same kind of game sniper elite in the other side of World War II background, so it’s very popular It’s understandable that many players don’t know about this series.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A game series with 11 years of history, how to make generations of bad reviews and continue to be new/2bb424fb3ab54b099df52eab8d4ab2ce.jpg" alt="A game series with 11 years of history, how to make generations of bad reviews and continue to be new"><br>Sniper Elite<br>The first generation of “sniper” was born in 2008, with the subtitle “art of victory”. It is an FPS game with World War II as its background. During that time, the linear FPS game was at its peak, with the call of Duty series as the representative of such games, while “art of victory” is also such a FPS game, just fixing the protagonist of the story as a single role 。 The player is going to control a Soviet sniper to engage with the German army in various environments. The highlight of the game is the long-distance sniper and the interaction between weapons and scenes. However, this game has a very excellent theme, and its screen performance is very backward. No matter the game mechanism or the enemy’s AI performance is very poor, and bugs are almost everywhere in the game. According to the integrated evaluation of the scoring website Metacritic, this game only gets a media average score of 36 points (full score of 100), and the player’s score is only 3.4 (full score of 10), most of which are given by the media The evaluation of “bad, not worth playing” is enough to prove how bad the performance of this work is, and Ci’s first attempt on a new subject eventually ended in failure.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A game series with 11 years of history, how to make generations of bad reviews and continue to be new/a848d30ee9ab48a0b075266b917ffb3d.jpg" alt="A game series with 11 years of history, how to make generations of bad reviews and continue to be new"><br>Sniper: the art of victory</p>
<p>In the early years, all the shooting Games launched by CI were based on the theme of World War II, while the art of victory is just one of many works, and the series of Sniper: Ghost fighter we mentioned above is a new series after the background is changed to modern. It seems that CI intends to develop sniper as a series of IP. Ghost Warrior was released in 2010. The background of the game has been changed. Therefore, there are more detailed researches in the design of sniper system, such as the prediction of trajectory, the search for suitable gun points, and the use of props.<br>However, it has been 2010, and call of duty has been released to action black. The game picture performance is still very poor. The character modeling is very rough and the frame number is not stable. Many scenes can only be viewed from afar and not be played, and the frame number drops suddenly a little bit. As a sniper game, the most basic combat system is also unsatisfactory, and various kinds of execution are in progress The action will feel very heavy, and the level design of the game is relatively rough and there are lots of bugs. All these factors make the experience of the game very disturbing and unexpected. The work still failed.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A game series with 11 years of history, how to make generations of bad reviews and continue to be new/b136dd56f36546d7b01954e864fa4a01.jpg" alt="A game series with 11 years of history, how to make generations of bad reviews and continue to be new"><br>Sniper: Ghost Warrior<br>Here is a brief introduction to CI company, which is located in Warsaw, the capital of Poland. It has a company scale of more than 100 people and has branches all over the world. Although CI started late compared with some first-line companies, it developed very fast because of the merger of several companies and full working experience. Before cdpr became famous, this company was The former “Polish state-owned enterprise”. With the support of the state, the company was able to play the game in such a smart way. Only three years later, CI launched the sequel Ghost Warrior 2, and the quality of the game this time was almost the same as or even completely the same as the previous one. However, the official multi player model was not found after the sale, even because of this, many media played for this work The evaluation is lower than the previous one. It’s also ironic that Ghost Warrior 2 is the first third-party game work to adopt cry engine 3, but because it can’t control the difficulty of using the engine, it eventually leads to the unsatisfactory quality of the game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A game series with 11 years of history, how to make generations of bad reviews and continue to be new/99e223ae466f463caf917c8fbb8b3835.jpg" alt="A game series with 11 years of history, how to make generations of bad reviews and continue to be new"><br>Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2<br>And then look at Ghost Warrior 3, which was released two years ago. This time CI decided to go with the flow and change the game to the open world. In view of the problem of the game mode of sniper series and the unsatisfactory arrangement of the task system, many players thought that this time changing to the open world could optimize the game experience, but they still screwed up. The map of the game is very large, but the layout of strongholds is very scattered. Players spend almost half of the time running on vehicles in the process of the game. Although the content and system design of the game have increased, the problems that have appeared in the previous work have been well “inherited” in this work, and as always, they haven’t got the passing evaluation.<br>Many players said that this game is not as bad as the media said, and they are very happy to play. To be honest, if we can ignore the hard problems in the game, the experience of this game is pretty good. After a long-distance calculation, the head of the enemy will be shot off. That feeling is absolutely not available in other shooting games, but we can ignore these problems After all, there are still a few people with problems.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A game series with 11 years of history, how to make generations of bad reviews and continue to be new/3a9ebac261704bcd814cb177706900da.jpg" alt="A game series with 11 years of history, how to make generations of bad reviews and continue to be new"><br>Sniper: Ghost Warrior 3<br>    concluding remarks<br>With the support of the state, CI can insist on the promotion of the sequel under the condition of continuous word-of-mouth. In fact, they are also eager to make works that satisfy all people. However, because the development cycle of the game is short and the development cost is low, they need to save money and other things, so they can only put the quality problems of the game aside for the time being and complete the game as much as possible Rong, that’s why this company has so far over 100 works, but none of them can be called “masterpieces”, let alone 3a.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A game series with 11 years of history, how to make generations of bad reviews and continue to be new/e81ffff943154e6eadd042a3c07ea9ad.jpg" alt="A game series with 11 years of history, how to make generations of bad reviews and continue to be new"><br>To be honest, the author is still not optimistic about the new Ghost Warrior contract, which will be released two years later. After all, the company has no opportunity news or news recently. According to the company’s consistent production level, maybe this time will still be a rotten work. However, there is no doubt about it. In recent years, CI has a trend of jogging with Xiaobu. Although there are many players with such ideas, we all hope that this company can actually hit our face once and make a really convincing excellent work.</p>

    <title>After a year of verbal criticism, battlefield 5 finally ushered in his second spring</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/After%20a%20year%20of%20verbal%20criticism,%20battlefield%205%20finally%20ushered%20in%20his%20second%20spring/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>On October 28, EA’s top FPS game “battlefield 5” announced the upcoming updates, and finally opened the Pacific War plate nearly a year later. The U.S. Army and British army joined in the game, and the highly praised Wake Island and Iwo Jima island in the early game series “battlefield 1942” were returned. Although there are still many problems in battlefield 5, the scale of the game is gradually enriched.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/After a year of verbal criticism, battlefield 5 finally ushered in his second spring/3a2c738a5ac44d8abb82993597449e6b.jpg" alt="After a year of verbal criticism, battlefield 5 finally ushered in his second spring"><br>Looking back on the development of battlefield 5 this year, we can say it’s not easy, but it seems that in addition to every content update, there are not many good news related to it, but negative news will always appear every other time. Now the game is about to usher in the second year, but there are still many holes not filled in, combined with the previous EA’s various operations Let a lot of players think that he is designing the next big game, but in fact, everything is just EA trying to make the game live for a few more days.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/After a year of verbal criticism, battlefield 5 finally ushered in his second spring/1a07b5c2bef34dcea1a03e9e3ea2ca3a.jpg" alt="After a year of verbal criticism, battlefield 5 finally ushered in his second spring"><br>    wind review<br>Since the official release of battlefield 5 in May last year, the controversy about this game has not stopped. It is necessary to know that the public praise of the previous generation’s work battlefield 1 is really good. Not only is the game rich in content, but also the experience of Watching God like flying boat battle is unprecedented. After all, there are too few people who have done the theme of World War I, players They are very interested in these new things, and the performance of the game has not disappointed the players, so the players are also full of expectations for the return of World War II “battlefield 5”. However, when the first trailer of the game was released, it almost caused the dissatisfaction of the players in a flash. Not only did the elements and modeling design in the movie violate the historical records, but also the design of forcing a game UI interface into the CG to serve as the screen of the game’s real machine was a little confusing. Many people even doubted whether EA really put it into practice Players are treated as fools, really think that players will believe it after watching this trailer.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/After a year of verbal criticism, battlefield 5 finally ushered in his second spring/3f51bff70ec14553b4c72e5bc8c2a395.jpg" alt="After a year of verbal criticism, battlefield 5 finally ushered in his second spring"><br>British female soldiers and prosthetics never appeared in the history of World War II<br>Players protested against dice, the developer of the battlefield series, saying they wanted dice to respect history. Even though dice wanted to try something new in the Old World War II game, it couldn’t be changed. In an interview with the players, Patrick sodlund, chief creative officer of EA’s CCO, said that those who said they did not respect history lacked cultural education. They were so designed because these scenes in the trailer were completely possible. No matter whether they were female soldiers or artificial limbs, after all, few people have been in these battlefields, Besides, it’s just a game. Why so serious? If you don’t like it, you can’t buy it. It’s hard to imagine that this kind of disaster speech against the players comes from a senior manager who has worked in EA for many years. This remark is to make those players who are dissatisfied with the game setting become more and more angry. Since the officials say that they can’t buy if they don’t like it, they just don’t buy it. After all, we are all illiterate people.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/After a year of verbal criticism, battlefield 5 finally ushered in his second spring/3c1f33592dd048c2a932c41c9ac98d9a.jpg" alt="After a year of verbal criticism, battlefield 5 finally ushered in his second spring"><br>Patrick sodlund, has left<br>The author was lucky to participate in the beta test when the game was launched. Compared with battlefield 1, the changes in this work are quite large, especially in the cooperation of small teams. The TTK that players can kill an enemy has become shorter, but the ammunition in each player’s hands has become much smaller. Most automatic weapons only have two magazines, so they cooperate with small teams to implement tactics It’s becoming more and more important. Each player’s occupation must do their own essential work to carry out the battle smoothly. This change may not be suitable for many old players, and they can get a good experience after they are used to it. But let’s not talk about the changes of the system mechanism of the game for the moment. Instead, when the game is launched, it not only tempts the players to buy the game as members in a variety of ways, but also lacks the content of the first version of the game. There are very few content and maps to play, and only the British and the German can choose. The weapons are also designed around these two forces.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/After a year of verbal criticism, battlefield 5 finally ushered in his second spring/8f2dfdfa611f4e96be1f18b3447f6de5.jpg" alt="After a year of verbal criticism, battlefield 5 finally ushered in his second spring"><br>There’s nothing to say about the frost engine</p>
<h1 id="grindstone"><a href="#grindstone" class="headerlink" title="grindstone"></a>grindstone</h1><p>The media gave a medium rating for the game, because in fairness, the performance of the game in innovation is relatively acceptable, and it has a very good foundation, but the content is still to be improved. Despite the accuracy of historical background and bug, the experience of the game is pretty good, but you need to know that the first game of dice, battlefield 1942, was launched It is rich in content and has the scale of a World War II FPS game. However, as a sub era work, “battlefield 5” is better than “1942” in terms of screen performance, and its content is not increased but regressed. In view of this situation, EA launched a plan called “the tide of war”. The content update in the game will be launched according to the records in the real history. It has to be Tucao, the game itself has many problems in the accuracy of history, but in this so-called “tide of war” is particularly true.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/After a year of verbal criticism, battlefield 5 finally ushered in his second spring/469a73ee889a46d4a386659845b6d3f2.jpg" alt="After a year of verbal criticism, battlefield 5 finally ushered in his second spring"><br>Second half renewal plan announced in the first half of the year<br>You can see that dice just wants to make a better step for yourself. Disaster level public relations comments and unsatisfactory initial performance have a direct impact on the sales volume of the game. There are not a few players who should not buy the game according to the voice of CcO. In addition, the digital version of the game is changing how to look at it. By withholding a little more money from the players and promoting their member services, EA can be said to be arrogant to the extreme this time, and the players are also ruthless with actual actions In the face of EA, the first week sales volume of battlefield 5 was even lower than the previous most popular police and bandit theme work battlefield: hard battle, which directly led to a large number of retailers hoarding Physical Games began to implement discount measures to clear their own inventory as soon as possible. After all, if this kind of game is not sold as soon as possible, I’m afraid it will never be sold again.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/After a year of verbal criticism, battlefield 5 finally ushered in his second spring/882dedb4ccea4707bb7f136dbfa58a67.jpg" alt="After a year of verbal criticism, battlefield 5 finally ushered in his second spring"><br>Battlefield: a tough battle<br>In the next period of time, it seems that EA always wants to attract more new players into the pit as much as possible, so it changes and changes the game, and sometimes it launches a big discount to try to make new players have a better experience when they play, but in fact, these changes do not have any more obvious effect, but they still annoy those who still insist on playing Family, and again and again discount is like stabbing in the hearts of those loyal fans who bought the game at the original price. If the content is less, it will be more quickly. If the bug is not repaired quickly, the so-called “wave of war” is also a strong ticket skipping. On the contrary, it is obviously not feasible to just think about getting more oil and water. At the end of March this year, “battlefield 5” added a so-called most gorgeous “fire storm” big escape mode. It seems that the FPS game of one’s family will not enter the stream without a big escape mode. But in addition to the cool screen design, the game experience of this big escape is not bright compared with other works, and it is not as interesting as the next door “apex”. This mode is also very fast and cursory No popularity.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/After a year of verbal criticism, battlefield 5 finally ushered in his second spring/9c384f0c1cf745c99e7a12e08cb8dfde.jpg" alt="After a year of verbal criticism, battlefield 5 finally ushered in his second spring"><br>Flames storm<br>    concluding remarks<br>Since then, all the news about battlefield 5 has either been updated or gone wrong. Today, there is a bug that can be invisible. After two days, it announces which mode or option to remove, and the big escape is because there are too few players to play the game directly. But even so, there are still a group of players who stick to the game and look forward to the next update. Some of them may just like World War II, and some may like the design of battlefield 5. With the support of these players, the game has come to today step by step.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/After a year of verbal criticism, battlefield 5 finally ushered in his second spring/7212246d63254290b460dc14981065a6.jpg" alt="After a year of verbal criticism, battlefield 5 finally ushered in his second spring"><br>The second year’s game cover revealed by netizens<br>The time of one year is neither long nor short. Now battlefield 5 has changed significantly compared with its debut, but it’s hard to let those regretful players go back to the pit. I hope that in the next year, battlefield 5 can continue to update to let the players see their sincerity, or simply make another game.</p>

    <title>A game company that teaches players how to fancy and grab money but makes itself bankrupt</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/A%20game%20company%20that%20teaches%20players%20how%20to%20fancy%20and%20grab%20money%20but%20makes%20itself%20bankrupt/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>If someone asks what is the biggest highlight of gta5 online mode, I think most people’s first reaction is to rob Pacific Bank with friends in gtaol. However, from an objective point of view, the robbery task in gtaol is like a large copy. It’s a set of process that how to play after finding out the process and mechanism. If it’s not that the price in gtaol is too expensive, it’s necessary to purchase assets by robbing accumulated funds in the early stage, which is the only way to get money quickly. It’s estimated that no one will try again after being fresh 。<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A game company that teaches players how to fancy and grab money but makes itself bankrupt/ae3a173b15f24536a12b5587d79a6a2e.jpg" alt="A game company that teaches players how to fancy and grab money but makes itself bankrupt"><br>When it comes to “gtaol” and “robbery”, we have to mention the “payday” series, which is often compared with “GTA”. Although the design of GTA for the task of robbery mode is very wonderful, “robbery” is only a small part of the game, while “harvest day” is more pure, because this is a no compromise “robbery” game.<br>The author has been paying attention when the series of “harvest day: plunder” was launched. At that time, it was forced by the conditions, and not everyone had the conditions to experience it. The relevant news of the game was also obtained through various magazines. At that time, the author first saw this very iconic mask suit mob, and for a long time, he was haunted. The success of harvest day has been reported in the magazine for a long time, but my little friend and I can only hope for the success of the magazine.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A game company that teaches players how to fancy and grab money but makes itself bankrupt/771ad5b3e50e41f7b037624974c14f13.jpg" alt="A game company that teaches players how to fancy and grab money but makes itself bankrupt"><br>The four protagonists are representative enough</p>
<p>#The most primitive desire<br>Overkill, a little-known studio from Sweden, formerly known as grin, has been doing the business of helping others to do foundry work before the development of harvest day. The second generation sequel of the classic IP “resurrection of the demons” under Capcom of Japan, the Bionic Commando, was created by them. Although the quality of the game is good, but their business is not good, so it was not long before they went bankrupt, but the members of the original studio still wanted to play games, so they set up a new studio, overkill, with the regrouping of people.<br>Just like their name (super kill), this time they want to do something different. They want to make a FPS game with crime as the theme. In this game, there should be a fierce police and bandit war, a comprehensive game system, and they should draw inspiration from various crime films. If they are a robber, what should they pay attention to in the process of crime Face, how to plan, so this FPS for robbery purposes is outlined, and this game also has a very topical name “payday”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A game company that teaches players how to fancy and grab money but makes itself bankrupt/ddd95b4f2ac14690b45b5673325964ef.jpg" alt="A game company that teaches players how to fancy and grab money but makes itself bankrupt"><br>As a criminal, in front of the flood police, all you can rely on is your partner and the weapon in your hand<br>Christianity once said that human beings are born with “original sin”. It is the root of all kinds of sins, which will lead people into the abyss of sin and make people unable to extricate themselves. Under all kinds of pressures in life, who hasn’t the impulse to be a bad person in the past? In fact, it can’t be said that everyone’s heart yearns for freedom and unrestricted life, but everyone knows that this is impossible, and everyone must abide by the rules of the world.<br>In order to get the release from this depressed mood, we can only get rid of it by other ways. Some people are willing to exercise, some people are willing to go to bars, and most people like to vent their emotions in the game. Therefore, there is a vote of GTA and similar GTA works with crime as the selling point, and harvest day is just looking at this point, and it will be a crime tour The most irresistible part of the play is taken out alone and enlarged, which satisfies the players’ desire in the most direct way: everyone wants money, and you can do whatever you want for money.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A game company that teaches players how to fancy and grab money but makes itself bankrupt/63341988d7e14a508e1cc8492de851bb.jpg" alt="A game company that teaches players how to fancy and grab money but makes itself bankrupt"><br>In the face of so much money, everyone wants to pack an extra bag and take it away, but they may pay for their greed</p>

Before committing a crime, players need to go to the target location as civilians to “touch the door” and start planning and implementation after mastering the necessary information. The whole process requires four players to unite to “declare war to the society”. Once the game was launched, it became a hit in a short time, and overkill finally saw their “gold”.<br>As a type of game with sensitive subject matter, there are many popular opinions, such as natural and social disputes, promoting crime and corrupting social ethos. If there is a problem with this game, I’m afraid that all relevant works of police and bandits in the world have problems. This topic is not initiated by harvest day for a day or two. Understand It’s natural for people to understand.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A game company that teaches players how to fancy and grab money but makes itself bankrupt/05b0d35671914a7f99d2874646c51160.jpg" alt="A game company that teaches players how to fancy and grab money but makes itself bankrupt"><br>The success of harvest day: plunder attracted starbreeze, another game company that just started to focus on distribution. At that time, starbreeze was worried about how to make a living because of its limited technical force and poor game quality. The company’s situation was not optimistic, and the success of harvest day attracted starbreeze’s attention When people were not optimistic about harvest day, they saw the potential of overkill and decided to buy the team even if they lost their money.<br>With a new owner and a certain amount of capital, the erratic overkill can finally develop new games in a down-to-earth way. With the help of starwind, only two years later, it launched the orthodox sequel harvest day 2. The sequel greatly strengthened all game systems on the original basis, enriched the game content, and once again achieved a double harvest of word-of-mouth and sales volume.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A game company that teaches players how to fancy and grab money but makes itself bankrupt/df33039d9d3a49ed93f4685f9fb9816b.jpg" alt="A game company that teaches players how to fancy and grab money but makes itself bankrupt"><br>In particular, the quality of the game’s audio-visual BGM is so high that it can’t stop in the process of the game as if it were poisoned</p>
<h1 id="if-you-don’t-do-it-you-won’t-die"><a href="#if-you-don’t-do-it-you-won’t-die" class="headerlink" title="if you don’t do it, you won’t die"></a>if you don’t do it, you won’t die</h1><p>But it seems that the success of the game makes Xingfeng forget the pain. Because the game’s discourse power is basically in his own hands, Xingfeng first planned to plan a large number of DLC schemes for the game, and then added the micro transaction (i.e. opening the box) in the game, which caused many fans’ dissatisfaction. Fortunately, after overkill regained the game’s copyright, the micro transaction was deleted, relying on the follow-up The high-quality updated content of the game maintains the livelihood of the game, but that’s nearly three years since the game was released. How interesting the game is, it’s fresh. Overkill also realized that the vitality of the game should come to an end. It’s time to launch a new work to replace harvest 2.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A game company that teaches players how to fancy and grab money but makes itself bankrupt/26e223c23987449aa7b69d779570fac2.jpg" alt="A game company that teaches players how to fancy and grab money but makes itself bankrupt"><br>If you ask which DLC is recommended to buy, the usual answer is to buy all<br>Although overkill is responsible for the development of the game, it seems that the success of harvest day has limited their imagination. The follow-up new work Raid: World War II is a complete copy of harvest day, and the setting is not rigorous, which has been criticized by the players for a while.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A game company that teaches players how to fancy and grab money but makes itself bankrupt/c3ba7a0e3fff4fb7a575550415508127.jpg" alt="A game company that teaches players how to fancy and grab money but makes itself bankrupt"><br>The setting of “raids: World War II” can’t tell which side of World War II it is<br>Xingfeng always thinks that he has enough capital and starts to focus on all kinds of strange projects. First, he looks at the potential of VR and plans to carry out VR business, but he doesn’t earn much money. Then, he pays a lot of money to buy Valhalla, a sub era engine that no one has heard of. As a result, the new engine can’t be used in the development of the new work. The new work “overkill walking dead” is more direct Published as a semi-finished product, it became a zombie theme game that copied the game of harvest day and played the same trick as Raider: World War II.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A game company that teaches players how to fancy and grab money but makes itself bankrupt/f628dee3ec09416f9a3611169e0b15fb.jpg" alt="A game company that teaches players how to fancy and grab money but makes itself bankrupt"><br>Because of copyright, the digital version of overkill’s walking dead is no longer available<br>The only successful game “killing machine at dawn” is just a novel way of playing. It was copied by other manufacturers, and finally fed other families, but it was cold. Star wind put all the treasure on the walking dead. As a result, if they didn’t play the game well, they just tossed and turned, forcing overkill to take out such things. Eventually, the sales volume didn’t reach the expectation, leading to the bankruptcy and reconstruction of the company, and the direction of overkill was not clear. The employees of star wind said that the pan had to be completely carried by the CEO who lacked leadership.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A game company that teaches players how to fancy and grab money but makes itself bankrupt/2c31b79eb2424ef79116e91840be41cf.jpg" alt="A game company that teaches players how to fancy and grab money but makes itself bankrupt"><br>Which game will carry forward the play method of “kill machine at dawn”, I believe most people know<br>    concluding remarks<br>After nearly half a year’s struggle, it seems that the company’s situation is not improved but more dangerous. Xingfeng is still making plans to reverse the situation after changing to a new senior level. They say that once the financing is available, they can look forward to the future again. It’s really a dying company that can say this. Now I look forward to the release of “system shock 3” for many years, but it seems that developers are not willing to release it on their own, and I don’t know if there will be “harvest day 3” both joined the ranks of “lifetime”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A game company that teaches players how to fancy and grab money but makes itself bankrupt/5110edcccd0248618fcc4b7caf94c641.jpg" alt="A game company that teaches players how to fancy and grab money but makes itself bankrupt"><br>I can’t remember how long I’ve been waiting for this game<br>No matter what the company has done, the author hopes that he can survive this disaster. Although their previous behavior may be a little stupid, it is only personal factors. They hold the games that only they can make, so as not to let those talented gamers bury them, and also to prevent these classic IPS from ever reappearing.

    <title>A year later, the blizzard Carnival didn&#39;t disappoint the players</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/A%20year%20later,%20the%20blizzard%20Carnival%20didn&#39;t%20disappoint%20the%20players/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In view of the embarrassment of last year’s Carnival, many players once thought blizzard, a game company, was just like a fighter who couldn’t help himself, unwilling to become a miser in the mobile game market. “Don’t you have a cell phone?” It’s full of players’ satire and disappointment about Blizzard, and Blizzard seems to realize how embarrassing they were last year, so after holding for a whole year, they finally ushered in a wave of outbursts.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A year later, the blizzard Carnival didn't disappoint the players/8cd172314eba439faf6d4ff67a0f00ce.jpg" alt="A year later, the blizzard Carnival didn&#39;t disappoint the players"><br>In the early morning of November 2, countless Blizzard fans waited in front of the computer for the start of the conference, and the whole opening ceremony was almost full of dry goods, the most important of which was “Diablo 4” and “watch pioneer 2”. World of Warcraft was about to usher in the new 9.0 version, and “Legend of furnace stone” finally planned to add a new game mode. One after another heavy bombs hit the players. It seemed that they were a little excited to faint for a while. Everything was announced to the world: “Blizzard is back.”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A year later, the blizzard Carnival didn't disappoint the players/77238074cc3f4555b363f5aec7bfe69c.jpg" alt="A year later, the blizzard Carnival didn&#39;t disappoint the players"></p>
<h1 id="back-to-the-dark"><a href="#back-to-the-dark" class="headerlink" title="back to the dark"></a>back to the dark</h1><p>As the saying goes, “ten years for games, nine years for CG”, which is used to describe Blizzard is the most appropriate, and in this blizzard carnival, Blizzard did not waste this talent, as always began to broadcast. As the lights of the venue changed to bright red, the screen became more and more bright, and the huge logo appeared on the screen, which is the “Diablo 4” that players are looking forward to for many years. In fact, from a long time ago, the rumor that Diablo will launch the fourth generation of works has never stopped. As early as late last year, Kotaku, a foreign media, reported that Blizzard would release the news of Diablo 4 at the 2018 carnival, but because the official is not ready, the plan was cancelled at the last moment.<br>The incident was later denied by Blizzard officials, who said they did prepare a section to show the content of Diablo 4, which is still under development, but they did not decide to release it at this carnival. What we saw this year may be what the news said “the prepared content”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A year later, the blizzard Carnival didn't disappoint the players/0b3502c23bcb4e35a950263cda7a866b.jpg" alt="A year later, the blizzard Carnival didn&#39;t disappoint the players"><br>Diablo 4 leaked from the introduction of art set<br>According to the official, the story of Diablo 4 takes place in the future several years after various events in Diablo 3. Lilith, the daughter of Mephisto, the ancestor of human beings, began to extend her evil claw to St. hueari. He inspired the deepest evil in all people’s hearts and made the whole world fall into chaos and despair again. It is worth mentioning that this time, Diablo 4 will adopt a seamless open world map architecture, and for the first time provide a mount for players to use. Players can explore freely in this huge world, and can take risks in different areas in any order, which means that this work will use non-linear narrative for the first time.<br>Compared with “Diablo 3”, the screen of this work has been greatly improved compared with the previous work, and this work will become the first realistic game work in blizzard history, and allow players to customize their role image. From the existing information, this work is undoubtedly the biggest change in the whole series. I don’t know whether these new things can meet the needs of players.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A year later, the blizzard Carnival didn't disappoint the players/3b41c63ba59f4b22b99622df70cfbf06.jpg" alt="A year later, the blizzard Carnival didn&#39;t disappoint the players"><br>“Diablo 4” game reality screen</p>
<h1 id="Legend-Continues"><a href="#Legend-Continues" class="headerlink" title="Legend Continues"></a>Legend Continues</h1><p>“Watch the vanguard” can be said to be the youngest independent IP in Blizzard’s hands. It still has a very high popularity since it was launched. Although this game does not have a very high popularity in China, it is largely because of the acclimatization. This game has been mixed up in foreign countries, and has become another trump card work in Blizzard’s hands. “Watch pioneer 2” came on stage as the finale at the opening ceremony of this carnival. Also, some information of the game had been leaked at a very early time. It said that “watch 2” would be a game focusing on PVE versus war, and a large number of FPS materials derived from “StarCraft” that had been cancelled were used. In fact, Blizzard confirmed this point when it officially released “watch 2”. It said that the PVE mode of four people cooperation in “watch 2” was to cater to the long-term petitions of the players, and what they always wanted to do. It opened a new chapter for this legendary science fiction hero story.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A year later, the blizzard Carnival didn't disappoint the players/f6c6296c85704909adef4f4814e8ceb6.jpg" alt="A year later, the blizzard Carnival didn&#39;t disappoint the players"><br>The hero lineup is now open<br>Because the game scale of PVE is much larger than the simple 6v6 competition mode, the upgraded engine is used in watch 2, which is more abundant in map scene scale, special effects and details. This does not mean that “watch 2” is a pure PVE game, and the traditional 6v6 multi player competition will also be added to the game, and the players who play “watch 2” can compete with the players who have the previous works in the same world, the former players can also experience the new roles and maps, and the data and achievements between the two can be fully interconnected.<br>Strictly speaking, “watch pioneer 2” is more like a previous “2.0 version update”, which can be explained by the fact that the two games can communicate with each other, and it has been exposed that the two games will be merged into the same client in the future, while the players who do not purchase “watch pioneer 2” cannot play PVE mode, which is similar to “Fortress night” produced by epic 》Especially.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A year later, the blizzard Carnival didn't disappoint the players/2fc8ace112de4b13bd21bbeeeafeb86e.jpg" alt="A year later, the blizzard Carnival didn&#39;t disappoint the players"><br>“Watch the vanguard 2” game screen</p>
<h1 id="classic-continuation"><a href="#classic-continuation" class="headerlink" title="classic continuation"></a>classic continuation</h1><p>In addition to these two heavy bombs, Blizzard’s other games also have many “small moves”. After a series of controversies about the plot, world of Warcraft finally ushered in version 9.0. After burning the world tree and giving up the tribe to leave without permission, our queen Sylvanas ran to the frozen throne again and directly pouted the Lich King’s helmet, breaking the gap between the dead world and Azeroth and causing a series of events. As players, I We will face the events created by the Greek queen in person.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A year later, the blizzard Carnival didn't disappoint the players/2f83caa4d6604fb4b015316168715ff0.jpg" alt="A year later, the blizzard Carnival didn&#39;t disappoint the players"><br>The boundary between the two worlds is broken<br>After the self-propelled game of “Dao TA self-propelled chess”, “Dao TA Baye” and “the game of cloud top”, Blizzard finally joined the new round of “self-propelled chess battle” and launched the “pub war chess” mode for its card game “Legend of furnace stone”. Although the design and rules are different from the general self-propelled chess, the overall design is different from self-propelled chess Chess is the same, but whether Blizzard can survive in the new round of battle to the end depends on whether they can realize their unique ideas.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/A year later, the blizzard Carnival didn't disappoint the players/e89bc0267ccf42d18f18cc9d3dcf32a6.jpg" alt="A year later, the blizzard Carnival didn&#39;t disappoint the players"><br>Don’t control the battle by yourself<br>    concluding remarks<br>Although the content released at the carnival is full of weight, so that players can feel that Blizzard they once loved is finally back. This time, they didn’t play emotion cards, and everything is new content, but it’s more or less likely to be a bit of a hot follower. It seems that the number one card at this conference must be “Diablo 4”, which finally let the players put their hearts down. However, the quality of the game should not be commented until the game is officially launched. It’s a little helpless to watch players change from violent white to violent black, and the time of the night turns back to violent white. However, I believe that players have not enjoyed such exciting feeling for a long time.</p>

    <title>Another cultural shock in the field of games, what is the strange and familiar super leisure game</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/Another%20cultural%20shock%20in%20the%20field%20of%20games,%20what%20is%20the%20strange%20and%20familiar%20super%20leisure%20game/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I vaguely remember that at the beginning of last year, almost everyone around me was addicted to a small game called “jump and jump”. Since then, all kinds of small games like “jump and jump” have sprung up. Although the playing methods of these games are different, they are almost the same in the game experience. People’s ability to accept these games is far greater than the sense of exclusion. Therefore, no matter what kind of games they are, they can quickly get a batch of support in a short time.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Another cultural shock in the field of games, what is the strange and familiar super leisure game/e1dff2074f944f7fb06d393119eca454.jpg" alt="Another cultural shock in the field of games, what is the strange and familiar super leisure game"><br>Up to now, quite a few people are still playing these games. The players don’t know what these games are. They just know that these games are fun, addictive and don’t need to download different fees. With the increasing number of players, the game manufacturers begin to pay attention to this type. In order to facilitate communication, the industry has reached a consensus that the same kind of game is called “super leisure game”.</p>
<h1 id="“Minimalism”-in-all-aspects"><a href="#“Minimalism”-in-all-aspects" class="headerlink" title="“Minimalism” in all aspects"></a>“Minimalism” in all aspects</h1><p>To explain it in a popular way, the so-called super leisure games are not much different from arcade games in terms of playing methods and modes. It depends on how long you can stick to your life and get high scores as much as possible. The playing methods and rules of these games are usually easy to understand and use. At the same time, they don’t need additional download and installation. They can be opened and played anytime and anywhere, making full use of players’ fragmented time.<br>The origin of super leisure games can be traced back to the era of “national Nokia”. Basically, there will be a “greedy snake” or other leisure games in mobile phones. These games were first launched on the arcade platform in the early years, and then transplanted to the mobile platform. These games fully retain the characteristics of arcade games. How long a life can last depends on personal technology and consciousness, and it is very thrilling and exciting to play. Even if the game picture is very simple, it still has endless fun. Later, with the rise of smart phones, the quality of games has been improved. Many manufacturers are committed to restoring the game experience of the host platform on the mobile platform, but there are also some stores that insist on making lightweight leisure games.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Another cultural shock in the field of games, what is the strange and familiar super leisure game/ebf54c4c1de14e1b8ef86f42f3c04fb3.jpg" alt="Another cultural shock in the field of games, what is the strange and familiar super leisure game"><br>Snake eating<br>Let’s try to recall what are the most representative mobile games in the early days of the rise of smart phones? Such as “Temple Escape”, “fruit ninja”, “graffiti jump” and so on have been very popular for a while, which have left a deep impression on the players. In short, this type of game exists in the same way, and has been thinking for quite some time, but it has not been recognized by the public, knowing to enter the mobile game market, combined with the unique characteristics of the mobile platform, which can be valued by people.<br>Nowadays, making a super leisure game needs three features: simple, intuitive, interesting and addictive playing method; simple and eye-catching painting style, small size and even no download; no payment and no internal purchase, and revenue through the game’s built-in advertising. The integration finally converges into two words: simplicity. In a word, everything that can be contracted should be simple, even the addictive way is also very simple.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Another cultural shock in the field of games, what is the strange and familiar super leisure game/41cd45f1fbd14a21a466029a8d40ee5d.jpg" alt="Another cultural shock in the field of games, what is the strange and familiar super leisure game"><br>Fruit ninja</p>
<p>#Instant explosion<br>What kinds of games are popular in the mobile game market now? I don’t believe I need to elaborate too much here. Most of the extremely popular mobile games are competitive types of “fighting with people”, or card RPG games that require players to invest their time and energy for a long time. These games are called “heavy Games” no matter how fast the rhythm is or how “liver degree” is. Their purpose is to keep players for a long time to create stable income. The profit mechanism of these games is even more mature than many end games, so they can maintain long-term vitality.<br>After all, not everyone likes to play these kinds of games. Nowadays, with the acceleration of the pace of life, most of the players will not invest too much time and energy in the game, but what follows is that the frequency of people’s “fragment time” is much higher than before, obviously using this Limited fragment time to “eat a chicken” or a plate of “glory of the king”, obviously It’s not very realistic, so players have the demand for “leisure”. It can be said that the success of super leisure games is expected by many manufacturers.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Another cultural shock in the field of games, what is the strange and familiar super leisure game/0ff5415ef6b54bfca7ec09c5cfd0550d.jpg" alt="Another cultural shock in the field of games, what is the strange and familiar super leisure game"><br>Collapse 3<br>Don’t underestimate the coverage of leisure games. Although it seems that the topic and flow generated by these leisure games are far less than those of popular competitive games, the audience groups of leisure games are not as limited as those of video games. If the focus groups of popular games are “players”, then the audience groups of these super leisure games are each one Smartphone users, this group includes players and people outside the players, some just to pass the time, some just for fun, so the coverage of leisure games is even higher than those popular games.<br>These lightweight games have a short development cycle and low cost, and the revenue that can be created for them can easily achieve considerable results. Therefore, they begin to prevail in the game industry gradually, and more and more people participate in it to develop this fertile land. And its real “tipping point” is the beginning of 2018.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Another cultural shock in the field of games, what is the strange and familiar super leisure game/ed4ca7f9a06047e6abeebb43fb1c9829.jpg" alt="Another cultural shock in the field of games, what is the strange and familiar super leisure game"><br>Candy legend</p>
<p>#Short life<br>In the past year, super leisure games have developed rapidly at an unprecedented speed. Many super leisure game manufacturers’ annual revenue is about 2-2.5 billion US dollars. Looking at the domestic mobile game rankings, most of them are the “heavy game” just mentioned by the author. In the overseas market, several works occupying the rankings for a long time come from four companies: France and France Under the influence of China’s Voodoo, Ubisoft’s affiliated katchapp, UK’s kwalee and rising star lion studio, it’s better to say that those “tough characters” who can break into the top ten are the rarest ones.<br>As I mentioned above, these games are usually free of charge and no internal purchase. They guide the players through built-in ads to make profits. In short, the purpose of these games is to promote other games. Therefore, the length of the life of these games depends on whether the advertisers can master the use of leisure games to promote themselves. After all, there are games on one side and there are games on the other People, once combined, can make profits.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Another cultural shock in the field of games, what is the strange and familiar super leisure game/63c0fa834eb54c489312c6adca5ad55d.jpg" alt="Another cultural shock in the field of games, what is the strange and familiar super leisure game"><br>Black hole battle<br>After all, the size of such a game is not large, so its playability is very limited. Usually, the heat of a super leisure game will soon disappear, even those heavy game players will feel tired after a long time, not to mention the poor playability of leisure games. However, super leisure games can make use of different game works to make users stay in their own games for a long time through creative realization. After all, the profit of the game is not directly proportional to the cost, and the cost paid by the developers is far lower than their income, so that the developers can discard the lost enthusiasm works and start to develop new works without any pain. It solves the problem of user number and revenue, and then another problem emerges: since the number of users of super leisure games is so large, what impact will it have on the whole game industry?<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Another cultural shock in the field of games, what is the strange and familiar super leisure game/2387492d05174beba880f9416a1b44da.jpg" alt="Another cultural shock in the field of games, what is the strange and familiar super leisure game"><br>Love ball</p>
<p>#Conclusion<br>In my opinion, super leisure games have undoubtedly injected a lot of fresh blood into the game market. After all, the lower limit of its audience is very low and the upper limit is very high. More people swarming into this field means that it can bring revenue to the game industry, and the revenue can stimulate more people to join in the game development industry. With them, there will be new games, and new games can be promoted It is undoubtedly a virtuous circle for new players to generate more revenue. The low threshold of super leisure game makes more people who have not been exposed to the game participate in the attempt. It can be said that it is the most suitable existence for a “user” to become a “player”, which can be said that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Another cultural shock in the field of games, what is the strange and familiar super leisure game/76f11630dc604b569a9bd59d74eaf96f.jpg" alt="Another cultural shock in the field of games, what is the strange and familiar super leisure game"><br>Crowded city<br>But it’s hard to say whether there will be profit driven companies in the future. Once a good game environment is connected with capital, it will easily become a mess. Fortunately, at least it hasn’t appeared at this stage.

    <title>After four years, blood source is still full of vitality. Is it just dark style</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/After%20four%20years,%20blood%20source%20is%20still%20full%20of%20vitality.%20Is%20it%20just%20dark%20style/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Some time ago, the game circle entered the off-season, and there was a long time between the release of masterpieces and masterpieces. The game I was playing was almost finished, and I also entered a “game shortage” stage. After rummaging through his inventory, he found that there was a “blood source” on the host that had not been touched for a long time, and had never been opened after passing the Customs for a week, while the content of DLC had not been touched at all, so he opened the game on a whim and tried again.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/After four years, blood source is still full of vitality. Is it just dark style/76d72057641c4380950cdfa2a6233b14.jpg" alt="After four years, blood source is still full of vitality. Is it just dark style"><br>Players who have been exposed to the “soul” series of works should know that they can often see in the online mode of the game. At the same time, the virtual shadows of other players in the game can also see the pools of blood left on the ground by other players due to death in all parts of the map, or the messages and prompts left by players in all parts of the map. At this time, it has been more than four years since the game was released, and I am surprised to return to the ancient capital of Yanan again. Even after such a long time, I can still see a lot of traces of other players on the map, especially in the place where powerful monsters occupy, which shows that there are still not a few players who are infatuated with this game If we think about the reason carefully, we can get the answer.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/After four years, blood source is still full of vitality. Is it just dark style/e75b1286142342f6958f8d7403aa938e.jpg" alt="After four years, blood source is still full of vitality. Is it just dark style"></p>
<h1 id="identify-a-“black”"><a href="#identify-a-“black”" class="headerlink" title="identify a “black”"></a>identify a “black”</h1><p>There are not many “dark” style game works on the market, but most of them are very good works. In the early years, the best representative of “dark” is Blizzard’s “dark Destroyer” series. Now, when players talk about “dark”, they will think of fromSoftware’s “soul” series. No matter the spirit of the devil, the soul of darkness or the blood source, they all put a lot of ink on the dark side. Different from the previous magic story style, not only the world view and the game plot are very gloomy and silent, but also the game scene design and the overall color are cold black and white gray. FS’s first console game work “King’s secret order” was launched in 1994, using the popular first person 3D perspective at that time. Since the beginning of this work, FS has adopted a relatively cool and dark game style, which also lays the main tone for a series of “dark RPGs” in the future.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/After four years, blood source is still full of vitality. Is it just dark style/4a13cca896d847608845e83c410df158.jpg" alt="After four years, blood source is still full of vitality. Is it just dark style"><br>If the Kingdom secret order has laid the core playing method and main tone for the company’s RPG game, then FS launched the third person ARPG game devil’s spirit in 2009, which has completely established the overall framework of the company’s future works. It is from the development of this generation of works that a man named Miyazaki YingGAO participated in the development. Without his participation, there might not have been This work, and he also fully demonstrated his talent through this work, maybe sometimes running against the mainstream will not necessarily produce bad results. In any case, for FS and Miyazaki YingGAO, devil’s soul is only a bold attempt. It has been proved that this way is feasible, so they have the opportunity to continue to do it. The subsequent spirit sequel, soul of darkness, can be seen as the “parallel universe enhanced version” of devil’s soul, which has a greater momentum than devil’s soul There is no shortage.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/After four years, blood source is still full of vitality. Is it just dark style/28be30922f4a4dd5b06f79eaf02e4781.jpg" alt="After four years, blood source is still full of vitality. Is it just dark style"></p>
<h1 id="elegance-and-mystery-coexist"><a href="#elegance-and-mystery-coexist" class="headerlink" title="elegance and mystery coexist"></a>elegance and mystery coexist</h1><p>Back to the protagonist of our story, from the secret order of the kingdom to the soul of darkness, the loss of this hardline ARPG series is always based on the medieval magic, and it is inevitable that it will be a little boring after a long time. Even many fans of this series will feel numb in the face of so many works of the same type, so FS needs to launch a new one that can keep the original On the basis of the core, it can also make people feel fresh and fresh. The scene should be more gorgeous, the figure modeling and action should be handsome, and the combat system can no longer hold the shield like before. After several reflections, FS decided to pull forward the time and adopt the Victorian art style and the combination design of Gothic style and kesulu theme.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/After four years, blood source is still full of vitality. Is it just dark style/8ed22f5c50634da98776254c19e67995.jpg" alt="After four years, blood source is still full of vitality. Is it just dark style"><br>It is believed that Victorian and Gothic style is a very romantic and elegant design in the eyes of young girls. Many women like to design magnificent scenes for their films, TV works and games. These designs are very easy to poke their soft spots. If the former “dark” style is applied on this basis, it will be romantic again And elegance pack a layer of mystery and horror, the vast majority of people just look at their eyes will be overwhelmed by it, which is why many female players have joined the “suffering” since the beginning of this work. In view of its own “soul” series have relatively large male loyal fans, “blood source” as a derivative work of “soul” series, he no longer let the players play the “heavy shield” immortal knight, but let the players incarnate the night of full moon waiting for the opportunity to move the devil hunter, light and handsome clothes plus the weapons that can be transformed and various types of firearms to encourage the players to be brave Against the enemy.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/After four years, blood source is still full of vitality. Is it just dark style/ba6969bbb23c49e2a6227d5f03dfa664.jpg" alt="After four years, blood source is still full of vitality. Is it just dark style"></p>
<h1 id="good-experience"><a href="#good-experience" class="headerlink" title="good experience"></a>good experience</h1><p>When it comes to the combat system, I personally think that the battle of blood source is more immersive than the series of black soul, although there is not much difference in the overall thinking, compared with black soul, it is more conservative. “Black soul” provides players with two main ideas of weapon system. One is to use shield or weapon lattice to block the enemy’s attack and draw out space to attack the enemy. The other is to use lattice counterattack to open the enemy at the moment of the enemy’s attack and cause high damage. No matter which one, it seems to encourage players to conduct backhand attack through observation. In the blood source, players are encouraged to use firearms to interrupt the enemy’s attack at the stage of lifting hands to create a hard straightness. Firearms themselves are also weapons that can cause damage. Combined with a variety of weapons that can extend the scope of attack through deformation, players can attack the enemy first. If the attack fails to cause interruption and hard straightness, they can use firearms to “fight against firearms” Attack “,” blood source “in most of the enemies are agile and attack frequency is fast, if the first attack can occupy a great advantage, but only this small change, can mobilize the whole game’s battle rhythm.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/After four years, blood source is still full of vitality. Is it just dark style/646bc69dcebb43de9d90d455c6dac4f4.jpg" alt="After four years, blood source is still full of vitality. Is it just dark style"><br>And the most important thing is that the plot in blood source is relatively compact, and the people are relatively full. You can experience the game completely once, and you can also get a complete story after reading the information in the game. After all, whether there is a sequel is a problem. FS can only simply finish the story in one game, and no longer hide it again and again. Although it is the same work of “dark” series, due to the different background of the story, the creation of the character in this work is attractive both inside and outside, and the human character design is relatively beautiful, but the monster design is still as usual “weird”, which can create a strong contrast for the players, and the monster always gives people a sense of being damned, and if the human makes it For the enemy, it is very good to let the players put their personal feelings into it, so as to feel the delicacy of the game in the invisible side.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/After four years, blood source is still full of vitality. Is it just dark style/cc714d8c53114e64b9971a0e5ec30ba9.jpg" alt="After four years, blood source is still full of vitality. Is it just dark style"><br>    concluding remarks<br>To sum up, these may be part of the reason why the game is still full of vitality up to now. On the other hand, it has a lot to do with the game’s sequel becoming the “lifetime” series. Almost one year after the release of blood, there are calls for sequel every year. “If there is no blood sequel, derivative works are OK, but not blood Go kart is OK. “ Those who like “blood source” may not like “black soul”, but those who like “black soul” will like “blood source” better. In Sony’s press conferences every year, these players have been expecting Sony to bring some surprises to the players. At the same time, every year, some players discover new content of news reports in the play, such as mining game files, exploring abandoned material areas District and so on. It seems that they are so hungry and thirsty that everything in this work seems to have been discovered.</p>

    <title>After making several independent games, I dare to try 3a. Next is perhaps the most ambitious studio in China</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/After%20making%20several%20independent%20games,%20I%20dare%20to%20try%203a.%20Next%20is%20perhaps%20the%20most%20ambitious%20studio%20in%20China/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In this year’s cologne game show, which didn’t last for a long time, I was very surprised that Tencent, a domestic game manufacturer, also participated in the show, and brought an eye-catching game called “edge of rebirth”, and the developer of this game is our leading role today: next studio. But on the surface, this “rebirth edge” is an eschatological style third person shooting game with the theme of later apocalypse, which has the posture of a 3A masterpiece. Tencent does define this game as a 3A game for publicity. In the eyes of Gu Yu, the project leader of this work, this game is not a 3A at all, but rather a “2A” Game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/After making several independent games, I dare to try 3a. Next is perhaps the most ambitious studio in China/c3735046ad934556b33596a23e6579cc.jpg" alt="After making several independent games, I dare to try 3a. Next is perhaps the most ambitious studio in China"><br>In next’s understanding, the so-called “2A” game   refers to those works that are close to 3a in quality, but not as large as 3a in game volume. For them now, the resources they have are far from enough to support them to make a 3A, so they also call this game 2A works. Perhaps for many players, the name is a little strange, but this studio has a certain reputation in the independent game development field in China long ago. Now they are the most powerful independent game studio under Tencent. Suddenly they want to do 3a, which is a big step. Maybe they want to visit the whole country The play development industry, perhaps only they are the closest to the realization of “China 3A”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/After making several independent games, I dare to try 3a. Next is perhaps the most ambitious studio in China/e15728e5ecce455bba94d455fcdd0f3c.jpg" alt="After making several independent games, I dare to try 3a. Next is perhaps the most ambitious studio in China"><br>    low key<br>The beginning of everything will go back to the day about two years ago. On the steam platform, a very personalized independent game named “death comes”, which is officially defined as: This is a pixel wind puzzle game with the perspective of “the fourth person”. The price of the game is not expensive, and the pixel wind of the Q version is very pleasant, and the playing rule of the game is that players can’t see it See the God of death, by setting various mechanisms and traps in the scene to cause accidents, trying to kill as many characters as possible in a scene. In other words, some people may not believe that the original intention of the game development is to let players always be alert to the dangerous things and scenes around them in their daily life, and think about the value and significance of life. This game first appeared at Pax West in 2017, but at that time, next studio didn’t get its own exhibition area. Instead, it borrowed a small corner from a small manufacturer to put a notebook for players to experience the game. There were no posters, no licensing. If it wasn’t for several employees to greet outside, no one would notice this place at all.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/After making several independent games, I dare to try 3a. Next is perhaps the most ambitious studio in China/c12bea0f91ae48ce9232a449947ae89e.jpg" alt="After making several independent games, I dare to try 3a. Next is perhaps the most ambitious studio in China"><br>Why do they want to appear in such a low-key way as a studio under Tencent? To a large extent, they did so because they were Tencent’s studios. At that time, all the Games associated with the word “Tencent” would bring a layer of negative buffs. Next just didn’t want to be influenced by Tencent’s reputation, which affected the players’ established impression of them. In addition, their Games were more “unconventional”, so they decided to go low-key The result of being too low-key is that they can’t buy a booth. On the second day of the exhibition, Kotaku, a well-known foreign media, took the initiative to report on the game and called it “one of the five best games in Pax West 2017”. The pixel game with brilliant style was so lucky. With the help of many famous game bloggers, more and more players are aware of the name of next, and next is not proud of its short-term success. Instead, it starts to plan more game products and always requires to focus on quality.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/After making several independent games, I dare to try 3a. Next is perhaps the most ambitious studio in China/8b82f1ec2920453bb3ba1b7746f108d3.jpg" alt="After making several independent games, I dare to try 3a. Next is perhaps the most ambitious studio in China"><br>High yield<br>In the following period of time, next has stepped into a high-yield stage, launched several works one after another, and actively participated in various influential game exhibitions in China to expand its reputation. It is worth mentioning that many games in the studio are planned by art designers in the studio, so these games have a very unique style and play method. With more and more kinds of games covered by the studio, the scale of the studio is gradually expanding, ranging from small-scale puzzle to horizontal action rougelite sandbox, which has been tried in the very popular and popular types in the independent game field, and the most popular game in recent period is the main audio puzzle game “doubt” Case chases the sound “and what is worth mentioning most is that all of its original works are independent game of buyout system, without extra krypton content, which makes many players not only sigh: is this Tencent?<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/After making several independent games, I dare to try 3a. Next is perhaps the most ambitious studio in China/8d4c135359f5412bac93716b80cadc5f.jpg" alt="After making several independent games, I dare to try 3a. Next is perhaps the most ambitious studio in China"><br>“The pursuit of the suspect”<br>In fact, all of the studios have such excellent creative ability, largely due to the fact that most of the members of the studio are “old Jianghu” from famous game companies all over the world. For example, Shen Li, the general manager of the studio, once participated in engine research and development in Shanghai Ubisoft and epic on the cusp of the times. Therefore, whether in the operation of the studio or in the The development concept of the game has full experience, and other members have some experience in yubimontllier studio, or participated in the development and design of other Tencent games. Although the studio is very young, it is actually crouching tiger and hidden dragon. In their studio business philosophy, everyone is encouraged to participate in the creation of the game. If there are distinctive ideas and design inspiration, they are likely to be put on the official development agenda, even the ideal college students or interns are the same. For example, the highly acclaimed Games “Rainbow Falls” and “Nishan Shaman” are in this way Born in the background.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/After making several independent games, I dare to try 3a. Next is perhaps the most ambitious studio in China/c766a8ed235f40058f4a8b7eaa3836f8.jpg" alt="After making several independent games, I dare to try 3a. Next is perhaps the most ambitious studio in China"><br>Rainbow falling<br>   ambition<br>As the saying goes, if you don’t have a dream to be a human being, it’s no different from saltfish. Even such a studio that focuses on independent games always wants to make 3A games belonging to the Chinese one day. There’s a precedent for 3A games produced by small studios and popular in the world before, such as warframe, a popular 3A online game nowadays, but in different circumstances, In China’s game market, no one wants to earn money by 3A games. 3A means high investment and high risk. If one is not careful, it may capsize. Even Chinese players are not optimistic about China’s 3A games themselves, but borrow the comments of a big man on the Internet: 3a is not a face project, but has real benefits. Throughout the whole game market, many landmark games are 3A games. They represent the wind vane of the industry and the ceiling of the same type of games. They can not only lead the development of the game industry, but also win the appreciation and respect of others. Without the spirit of adventure, these games may never appear.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/After making several independent games, I dare to try 3a. Next is perhaps the most ambitious studio in China/3c3fe1cdf9ae4d4faf04c940696cce9c.jpg" alt="After making several independent games, I dare to try 3a. Next is perhaps the most ambitious studio in China"><br>In this year’s cologne game show, “the edge of rebirth” is next’s response to the industry. Although their resources are insufficient at this stage, if this problem can be overcome, then it is not difficult to develop a real 3a with the development ability of a studio and the experience of all “old drivers”. “Edge of rebirth” is developed by using the industry’s mainstream unreal 4 engine and supports the current hot RTX ray tracing technology. It has reached a higher level in both art and AI technology of the same type of game in China. However, after the game was released, because of the similarities between this game and many 3A works on the market, it has also been questioned and criticized by many players, but No matter what the conclusion is, at least next proves that China has the ability to develop 3A games with practical actions. In recent years, the popularity and attention of domestic games are also gradually increasing, and a considerable number of players still have high expectations for domestic game packages. No matter how bad Tencent’s reputation, one thing we have to admit is that if China can launch our own 3a, Tencent will certainly be a great contributor.</p>

    <title>Before Apple, jobs was employee 40 of yadali</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>With the development of science and technology, smart phones and personal computers have basically entered the era of national intelligent information. Smart phones and personal computers are basically personal standard and hard to leave hands. The birth of this phenomenon is largely inseparable from a company called “apple”. It is precisely because Apple’s iPhone and iPod series products constantly refresh the concept , which led to a wave of innovation from various manufacturers. Earlier, Apple also relied on Apple II to create the era of private computers. All these credits are attributed to the same person:   Steve Jobs  .<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Before Apple, jobs was employee 40 of yadali/26370654d1d3482aa1fafc797fce1e6a.jpg" alt="Before Apple, jobs was employee 40 of yadali"><br>Jobs is not only the founder of apple, but also a great inventor. Although he is no longer here, his contribution to the world can be seen by all. The digital products he designed have subverted people’s recognition again and again, and it is no exaggeration to call him “the man who changes the world”. What few people know is that before Apple was founded, jobs worked in the video game industry, and also produced a game that no one knew.</p>
<h1 id="maverick-hippies"><a href="#maverick-hippies" class="headerlink" title="maverick hippies"></a>maverick hippies</h1><p>Steve Jobs was born in San Francisco, California, in 1955, but unlike other children, he was abandoned by his parents from birth, but fortunately, a good couple adopted her. Jobs grew up living near Silicon Valley, a high-tech industrial area in San Francisco, so he loved electronics very much. When he was in junior high school, jobs met his best friend, Stephen Gary Wozniak (Woz for short). They both saw each other at first sight and were interested in electronics. Woz was also the Minister of the electronic club of jobs junior high school, so the two “Steve” came together. At the age of 19, he dropped out of Reed College in Portland, Oregon. The online records show that he failed to stick to it for economic reasons. In fact, it was Jobs’s abnormal aversion to the rules and arrangements of the University, which seemed to him that university life constrained his free life.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Before Apple, jobs was employee 40 of yadali/86a267805f77473f9fdd1e996740637e.jpg" alt="Before Apple, jobs was employee 40 of yadali"><br>Jobs in his youth<br>That’s because jobs was a real Hippie during the age of the righteous anti culture movement. As we all know, in college, compulsory courses are required. Jobs hates the contents of those compulsory courses most, but he is fond of the contents of art, culture, philosophy and so on in the elective courses. No wonder he can’t stay in school. He was addicted to Buddhism and Zen, so he was fascinated by the holy land of Buddhism in India. But at that time, jobs was not in a good economic situation and lived like a vagrant, so he needed a job to earn the money for his trip to India. At the same time, Atari, a game company, has just stepped into a booming stage relying on several pong game consoles. They need to add some human resources, so they sent out recruitment notices. Among the numerous applicants, there are jobs.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Before Apple, jobs was employee 40 of yadali/5beeaa9e5d854d64b0b7dade6e05c34e.jpg" alt="Before Apple, jobs was employee 40 of yadali"><br>Pong brings video games to ordinary people</p>
<h1 id="access-to-yadali"><a href="#access-to-yadali" class="headerlink" title="access to yadali"></a>access to yadali</h1><p>He had no money, no education, and knew nothing about electronics. Jobs stepped into the door of yadali with only a passion. Yadali recruited electronic engineers. Obviously, jobs did not meet their requirements. According to the memory of the people present at that time, the clothes jobs wore on the day of the interview were very strange, and he also had long hair and beard, with a strong body odor, and was a complete tramp. In view of jobs’ Hippie character and arrogant attitude, he claimed that if yadali didn’t admit him, he would not leave, making the company’s security personnel once think that the insanity is to make trouble. The person in charge of the interview that day was al olkang, the chief engineer of yadali. The person in charge of soxin also informed olkang reasonably before the alarm. Olkang was very curious about this, so he decided to meet the hippie boy for a while.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Before Apple, jobs was employee 40 of yadali/8ece013e9efb440d957f83a9889e8960.jpg" alt="Before Apple, jobs was employee 40 of yadali"><br>Jobs’s face-to-face look is much more exaggerated than that<br>In Alcon’s view, although jobs has many shortcomings, he has a high enthusiasm for electronics. Although he has no education, he can feel that jobs has great intelligence, but he has not been brought into play. Just as an engineer named Don Langer needs an assistant, Alcon decided to give him a chance to try. In this way, jobs became the 40th employee of yadali. One day, the engineer named Don Langer complained to Alcon, “what did I do you want to do to me?” Jobs is an open heart and aggressive person who doesn’t hide his thoughts. So he speaks in a bad way. Because of his belief in philosophy and meditation, Jobs firmly believes that eating fruit based vegetarian food can help to savour the body, so that there is no need to bathe or perfume. Employees of yadali can’t accept jobs physically or psychologically, but Nolan Bushnell, founder of yadali, likes him a lot, so he arranges jobs to work at night, so that he doesn’t have to face other colleagues.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Before Apple, jobs was employee 40 of yadali/b05f21b8992b49a5bb810e867acd4ca2.jpg" alt="Before Apple, jobs was employee 40 of yadali"><br>Usually at home, jobs is also keen on meditation and meditation</p>
<h1 id="single-version-of-pong"><a href="#single-version-of-pong" class="headerlink" title="single version of pong"></a>single version of pong</h1><p>Even if he had a job, jobs still kept in touch with his best friend, Woz. Yadali is headquartered in Silicon Valley, while Woz works in HP company, which is also located in Silicon Valley. When he leaves benwoz, he goes to yadali to find jobs to help him solve technical problems. After a few months of work, jobs saves enough money to go to India and leaves temporarily Yadali went to India for a seven month spiritual journey. Seven months later, jobs went back to yadali to work on the night shift, and Bushnell was planning to make a single version of the “Pong” game. The player controlled the baffle to hit the ball on a wall composed of bricks. The bricks hit can be eliminated, and the small ball can be eliminated to eliminate all the bricks to win. Nolan knew about Woz’s frequent visits to yadali, so he gave the job to jobs. After all, wouldn’t it be nice for a salary to make “two Steve” work?<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Before Apple, jobs was employee 40 of yadali/848679784b844802bbd19cc93e441b3e.jpg" alt="Before Apple, jobs was employee 40 of yadali"><br>Woz on the left and jobs on the right<br>After receiving the job, jobs immediately asked Woz for help. He told Woz that the game needed to be developed within four days, and that if he could reduce the number of chips to less than 50, he would get a bonus, which he was willing to share with Woz. You know, at that time, the circuit board of a game arcade was usually 150 to 170. It was a big challenge to control the number within 50, but that’s what Woz was good at, because he used 30 chips to reproduce “Pong”. His engineering ability was really immortal. The company didn’t specify how many days the production time limit was. The four-day limit was purely due to jobs’s personal affairs, but he didn’t tell Woz about it. Woz accepted the challenge, and the two decided to cooperate. Woz was in charge of the project, while jobs was in charge of prototype construction and software testing.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Before Apple, jobs was employee 40 of yadali/be8eea2f476a49ad9cde7450536b5390.jpg" alt="Before Apple, jobs was employee 40 of yadali"><br>Nolan’s game prototype<br>The game did come out in 4 days, but it’s not an easy job. Although I don’t know how many chips were used, it was controlled within 50. But it is a pity that Woz’s engineering design can be called “masterpiece”, but no one can understand how it is realized, that is to say, only Woz can make this circuit board, which is totally unable to produce in mass in the eyes of ordinary people. But in any case, yadali kept their promise, gave them a bonus, and then found someone to rebuild a circuit board in a normal way. This game is later world-famous “brick”.<br>After completing this arduous task, the friendship between the two became deeper. Jobs had a dream of becoming an entrepreneur since then, and Woz’s engineering technology became more and more sophisticated. Soon after that, jobs left yadali, Woz left HP, and the two built the personal computer apple I in a garage with spare parts, and later founded apple , changing the world again and again to create history.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Before Apple, jobs was employee 40 of yadali/f55b5ace488a4acbb796b430d4ed0c56.jpg" alt="Before Apple, jobs was employee 40 of yadali"><br>Hand made soil computer apple I<br>End of<br>It can be said that without Woz, there would be no such achievement of jobs today. What few people know is that when yadali released “brick” to jobs, he paid $700 if he made the game, and a bonus if he controlled the chip within 50, but he didn’t say how much. Jobs told Woz that within four days, a chip with less than 50 chips would get 700 dollars, and the two could share equally, but he didn’t mention the bonus at all. After that, Woz did get a check for 350 yuan, but according to unreliable reports, Jobs himself received an additional 5000 dollars, which Woz didn’t get at all. Woz learned about this in a dinner with Nolan later. Although he was very sad, he didn’t care too much. He thought that jobs didn’t mention it to him. Maybe there was something difficult to talk about, but he still hoped that jobs would be frank with him. If he needed the money, he would give it to him without hesitation. After all, they were friends.</p>

    <title>Before wild escort 2 log into PC it&#39;s very good, but the player can&#39;t give it what he wants</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/Before%20wild%20escort%202%20log%20into%20PC%20it&#39;s%20very%20good,%20but%20the%20player%20can&#39;t%20give%20it%20what%20he%20wants/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>On October 4, 2019, Rockstar officially announced that its latest 3A masterpiece, the great escort in the wilderness: Redemption 2, will log into the PC platform on November 5.<br>This news is not long, but it makes the whole game circle boil. It has been a year since the game was released, but it seems that the discussion heat of the game in China only existed for a period of time when it was first launched, and the period when the online mode “wilderness escort ol” was officially launched. After that, the attention and topic of the game in China almost fell to the freezing point, and even the content update of the major version was rarely discussed The biggest reason is that there is no PC in this game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Before wild escort 2 log into PC it's very good, but the player can't give it what he wants/81825aef7cf14b6db21f5441c6fbec11.jpg" alt="Before wild escort 2 log into PC it&#39;s very good, but the player can&#39;t give it what he wants"><br>This time, the news that the game is about to land on PC is undoubtedly a good thing for the domestic players, which means that the game may have a high exposure and attention in China like gta5, and for those who really like the game, it must be a mixed story to know the news: to be able to see the game they like It’s a good thing to get more players’ attention. At the same time, “wild escort 2” as a landmark work of the open world in the industry, can also make more players once the style of this game. However, in view of the unique nature of the game itself, it is bound to cause a new round of controversy among the players again, and the focus of the controversy will be the platitude of “gameplay”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Before wild escort 2 log into PC it's very good, but the player can't give it what he wants/1e996c7f376041f9861daa16a2d067b9.jpg" alt="Before wild escort 2 log into PC it&#39;s very good, but the player can&#39;t give it what he wants"></p>
<p>#What’s good about it?<br>People who often watch overseas entertainment programs should know that in the impression of foreigners, when referring to the film and television related works of Western themes, they always refer to such representative classic works as “guanshanfeidu”, “tiger and leopard little overlord”, “golden three escort” and so on. Compared with the domestic fascinating martial arts children and girls in the Jianghu, I prefer these simple but elegant works Old legends that can be deeply rooted in people’s hearts. A cigarette, a pot of wine, a revolver, riding a steed on the sunset plain, watching the steam train flying across the horizon in the distance, maybe this is the unique romance of those rough and unrestrained tough guys. Although these stories are wonderful, they are not our own stories after all. Therefore, many Chinese people do not have too many emotional elements for these works. In addition, the western theme works are few in the current film and television field, which doomed the minority of this theme in China.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Before wild escort 2 log into PC it's very good, but the player can't give it what he wants/981521699ce54dad8749d4b2fcfd8ffb.jpg" alt="Before wild escort 2 log into PC it&#39;s very good, but the player can&#39;t give it what he wants"><br>The protagonist’s shape in the three golden escort should be the most popular<br>Western theme games have been on the market all the time, from action shooting to simulation management and so on, but they are gradually buried by history as western movies. If it wasn’t r star’s “the big escort in the wilderness”, people’s attention to this theme might have been gone for a long time. In short, if you don’t have a passion for this theme, you won’t be interested in these games, even if the developer is r star.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Before wild escort 2 log into PC it's very good, but the player can't give it what he wants/4e526f38c52042569863caee6b21acaa.jpg" alt="Before wild escort 2 log into PC it&#39;s very good, but the player can&#39;t give it what he wants"><br>The name R-star represents the highest development power of the whole game industry. Each generation of works can be regarded as an industry milestone in concept design and technical ability. And this generation of “big escort in the wilderness: Redemption 2” enables R-star to unite studios all over the world to develop even beyond the scale and treatment of “gta5”. Therefore, this work is not only in the picture performance but also in the game Capacity design is the strongest in this generation. At the same time, the game also has a very wonderful plot. R star always takes “to create a world for telling a story” as the concept, this time is no exception. Throughout the history of R star’s game, it seems that their stories are just like those of Stephen Chow’s films, with a small character as the protagonist, telling a story that is not painful to others, but not painful to themselves There is no absolute heroism in a significant experience, and there will never be so-called peace in the world.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Before wild escort 2 log into PC it's very good, but the player can't give it what he wants/ab5db32990764417b77c8c09501be3ce.jpg" alt="Before wild escort 2 log into PC it&#39;s very good, but the player can&#39;t give it what he wants"><br>R star has always been an unprecedented obsession with the details of the game. No matter the modeling and animation performance of the character or the series of special effects in the scene have reached the abnormal level. For example, the skin and muscle activities of the character and the bulging blood vessels can be seen clearly. Each interaction has script animation effect, or the raindrops under the eaves of the rainy house can even swing with the wind.<br>R star aims to create a near real western world to enhance the immersion of the game. Because everything in the game is so reasonable, players will feel a sense of “all phenomena in the game are reasonable”. Most of the time, players will think in combination with their common sense of life when they make actions, such as eating when they are hungry, Cold to add clothes, horse dirty to brush hair, do not pay attention to personal hygiene will be other NPC away and so on. This kind of thinking mode of the player is combined with the strong picture expressive force of the game, thus forming the “immersion sense” in the player’s impression, so as to achieve the desired game effect of R star.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Before wild escort 2 log into PC it's very good, but the player can't give it what he wants/7316fe4293cd4ce182342fc65341fb27.jpg" alt="Before wild escort 2 log into PC it&#39;s very good, but the player can&#39;t give it what he wants"></p>
<h1 id="double-blade-sword"><a href="#double-blade-sword" class="headerlink" title="double blade sword"></a>double blade sword</h1><p>To sum up, R star has made great efforts in shaping the “reality” of the western world and achieved the effect they have always wanted to achieve, and the biggest advantage of this game has just become the disadvantage of this game. Because the game has almost reached the abnormal level for the restoration of reality, its process is also very lengthy and complex in the actual play process. Take shopping in the store as an example, you can directly select the goods you need on the shelf and directly put them in your pocket to pay for people to leave, or you can go to the counter to browse the catalog of goods to choose. The specific process of the latter is: go to the counter , talk to the boss about the catalog, open the catalog, turn to the section you want to see, pay for the goods, close the book and return it to the boss, and leave the store. In reality, it’s almost the same process to order a dish in the restaurant, but the game has done every step of the operation, which makes the process of shopping in the game become very slow and complex. Some people may say that the way of shopping is very cool and delicate, but more people will say “why is it so troublesome to buy something?”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Before wild escort 2 log into PC it's very good, but the player can't give it what he wants/8fe8b29ada804da29327158bc0196eed.jpg" alt="Before wild escort 2 log into PC it&#39;s very good, but the player can&#39;t give it what he wants"><br>There are many other designs like this in the game, and this is also the biggest pain point of the game. Some people say that this game is a “cowboy Simulator”. Everything is good but not fun. Maybe in R star’s view, they think so, but it’s just what they want. They don’t care whether the player can be a wild man in the western world like in Los Angeles. They don’t care whether the game can be recognized by the vast majority of players. They just want to fulfill their expectations. The relationship with the word “Simulator” means that the game is destined to become a minority work again. After all, only a small number of people like to seek the truth in the game, but unlike other “simulators”, the “wild escort 2” is a top 3A work completely, and has a strong artistic flavor.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Before wild escort 2 log into PC it's very good, but the player can't give it what he wants/56761d049eb34ea19cc38f3c0696faa8.jpg" alt="Before wild escort 2 log into PC it&#39;s very good, but the player can&#39;t give it what he wants"><br>If you simply like R star’s style of action, development philosophy and players interested in Western themes, you may like this work very much and get the best game experience in the same theme game. As for the players who simply follow the trend, or who want to be a savage in the western world because they like GTA, they may feel disappointed after buying it and run to the community to scold the spicy chicken game. I don’t know why other people give this game a very high evaluation. Ironically, the players who belong to the latter in China may occupy the majority of the shares Well, there will be disputes between the two players. This is the current environment. Fast pace is simple and directly the mainstream. The famous slow pace and authenticity of “wild escort 2” is doomed not to be criticized by the mainstream groups, let alone a few true love fans to easily change this situation.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Before wild escort 2 log into PC it's very good, but the player can't give it what he wants/5136f8fde48d4cf9b9750652ba945edc.jpg" alt="Before wild escort 2 log into PC it&#39;s very good, but the player can&#39;t give it what he wants"><br>    concluding remarks<br>In the understanding of many domestic players, it seems that many of the first-line 3A masterpieces will die suddenly if they don’t get on the PC. this time, the “wild escort 2” will log on to the PC because of its low popularity. It’s necessary to make some money by copying another wave of enthusiasm on the PC. In fact, this is a big misunderstanding. The real reason is that the players’ petition for the PC is too loud, and R star does not want to live up to the expectations of these players this time. After all, the previous generation of works has not launched the PC version until today, but still does not affect the game has a very hot sales and high evaluation.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Before wild escort 2 log into PC it's very good, but the player can't give it what he wants/5ba15a3777ab4b078978628b401b9ccb.jpg" alt="Before wild escort 2 log into PC it&#39;s very good, but the player can&#39;t give it what he wants"><br>The previous generation’s work “the great escort in the wilderness: Redemption”<br>For “wild escort 2”, I’m very glad that R star still devoted himself to creating the real virtual world after tasting the sweetness in gta5. After all, the two games are quite different in style. If we add too many entertainment elements similar to those in GTA to “wild escort”, we will lose the original flavor of this theme. Although it’s a controversial work, it’s worth every player who loves the game to try. This time, the login PC also gives a green light to more players. The rest can only hope that this work can dominate the hot sales list like gta5 all the year round.</p>

    <title>Before the release of last survivor 2, we need to know how great it was</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/Before%20the%20release%20of%20last%20survivor%202,%20we%20need%20to%20know%20how%20great%20it%20was/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>At the Sony psx game show in 2016, Sean Leighton, President of Sony global studios, delivered an object at the end of the show. Just as the players were about to take a position with a little regret, Sean suddenly said “one more thing” and said that he would continue to distribute a classic game developed with a new engine. After the end of the video broadcast, the conference would be held End of style. The video shows the green forest, abandoned houses and streets. When a familiar logo slowly appears on the screen, it arouses the screams and cheers of all the audience outside the field and watching the live broadcast in front of the computer. When the title of the last of us: Part II is completed and now on the screen, quite a lot of the audience are in a state of great joy, And constantly give applause and cheers.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Before the release of last survivor 2, we need to know how great it was/7c093e02bda84be2848c087260290717.jpg" alt="Before the release of last survivor 2, we need to know how great it was"><br>Now it’s about four months before the release of “the last survivor 2”, and now it’s more than six years since his previous release. In this period, although some players once thought that the previous open-ended ending setting was unlikely to have a sequel, if it can be renewed, it’s undoubtedly something to celebrate. Since the birth of the series and then to the PS4 platform remake, it is basically defined as one of the masterpieces that must be played by the host, so this time we will talk about how this game can arouse the excitement and expectation of the players.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Before the release of last survivor 2, we need to know how great it was/dd48d08afa0a43b591b6083ca9a40ef7.jpg" alt="Before the release of last survivor 2, we need to know how great it was"></p>
<h1 id="box-sealing-work"><a href="#box-sealing-work" class="headerlink" title="box sealing work"></a>box sealing work</h1><p>In 2013, the mainframe of the last era has entered the end and is about to usher in the next era of update and iteration, but at that time, there were still a considerable part of the functions of Sony’s PS3 mainframe that have not been discovered, so many manufacturers are also scrambling to develop a work that is impressive enough to become the “sealed box work” of this mainframe and win The last “battle” of this generation of mainframe. The final winner of this battle is “gta5” brought by the “ceiling” level R star in the game industry. You should know that in the seven years of PS3’s life, R star only took five years to evolve from “GTA4” to “gta5” of today’s half sky level. The gap between the two is obvious to all.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Before the release of last survivor 2, we need to know how great it was/a44539c1e4c147f4a53268b11815b0dc.jpg" alt="Before the release of last survivor 2, we need to know how great it was"><br>Apart from “amazing”, I can’t think of a better description of gta5 in the same era<br>But Sony’s side is not to be outdone. Its third developer, naughty dog, has also brought a masterpiece exclusive work “the last survivor”. You should know that the naughty dog before this is the only representative work in addition to the series of “the ancient perplexed wolf”, which is the only one of the family’s pillars, and its influence is also one of the best in the whole game industry. And “the mysterious sea area” 》The series focuses on thrilling treasure snatching adventure, with the core of bringing Hollywood action movie level game experience to the players, but this time they want to tell a story seriously.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Before the release of last survivor 2, we need to know how great it was/c83e104951d54cbd8ceeaf3c4a1d46eb.jpg" alt="Before the release of last survivor 2, we need to know how great it was"><br>Mysterious sea area 2<br>Based on the modern background, the story tells of the outbreak of an infection event caused by a mutated fungus in late September 2013. Anyone infected by this fungus called Cordyceps will become unconscious and will only attack and bite other humans endlessly. Joel’s small town in Boston was also attacked by this fungus. Joel had to take her little daughter Sarah to escape in order to survive, but she was stopped by the government army on the way to escape. The government army, adhering to the concept of “killing a thousand people by mistake and never letting one go”, shot the protagonist’s party. Although Joel was not injured, her daughter Sarah Unfortunately, he was shot and killed. In fact, the soldier just obeyed the orders from his superiors, and didn’t want to shoot himself. He was stopped and killed by Joel’s brother Tommy in time, but Sarah’s death was irreparable. With Joel’s plaintive voice in the face of his dead daughter, the game officially began. It can be said that at the beginning of the game, it presented a dramatic performance with a strong impact and a sense of substitution for the players, capturing the players’ eyes instantly.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Before the release of last survivor 2, we need to know how great it was/39f52b83d22542cd8f81b9a5c4fc855d.jpg" alt="Before the release of last survivor 2, we need to know how great it was"><br>The protagonist Joel</p>
<h1 id="different-“survival-game”"><a href="#different-“survival-game”" class="headerlink" title="different “survival game”"></a>different “survival game”</h1><p>After the animation of the film, 20 years later, what happened in this period is unknown to us. We only know that Joel, who lost his daughter, has become more and more cruel and merciless. In order to survive, he can do whatever he wants. It’s easy to kill people and surpass goods. In the past 20 years, the whole country has become lifeless, and the government only governs the people in a relatively tough way at the lowest level. The government’s inaction makes people have the idea of revolt, so a revolt organization named “firefly” has been born. In this country, it has formed its own faction. By chance, Joel met Marlene, the leader of firefly, and in order to To get their weapons back from firefly, Joel made a deal with firefly to send them an “item”: 14-year-old girl Ellie. As we all know, this little girl has a constitution that can immunize against Cordyceps. Therefore, this little girl is probably the key to making a virus vaccine. It is the hope of the whole human future. Because Marlene is injured, Joel is entrusted to send Ellie to the firefly laboratory in another city. The core of the story is the very long journey.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Before the release of last survivor 2, we need to know how great it was/4d6fd8a8c2a2485184a4a6ca623a9393.jpg" alt="Before the release of last survivor 2, we need to know how great it was"><br>The second leading role: Allie<br>“The last survivor” is essentially an action adventure game with survival elements. There are other survivors and “zombies” infected by fungi everywhere on the way. What the players have to do is to find ways to survive in various scenarios and go to the destination smoothly. As a linear game, the playability of this work can not be said to be very high, but because of this very immersive plot and scene design, as well as the vivid characterization, the whole process of the game has a tense atmosphere at all times. Every battle requires the players to be careful. How to manage the materials, props and even ammunition is the key to the game. This is not the first time for naughty dogs to try the game works set by two protagonists. In the past “mysterious sea area”, although the player has been controlling the protagonist Nathan Drake, there is always a good partner who can pull you at a critical moment. This design has been used since the early generation of “mysterious sea area”, and in “the last survivor”, this setting is not only The key of the game process is the direction of the plot.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Before the release of last survivor 2, we need to know how great it was/087a9178552648de88938da88d0c3a71.jpg" alt="Before the release of last survivor 2, we need to know how great it was"><br>In this work, naughty dogs try their best to create a sense of immersion with a high degree of simulation, so many settings and designs are drawn from the real world, even the outbreak of infectious Cordyceps fungus is a real species in reality. On this long road, the change of mood between Joel and Ellie and the emotional transformation between them are the most striking places in this work. Along the way, two people have encountered various difficulties and dangers, chatted and quarreled with each other, from the cold talk to becoming an integral part of their lives. Joel needs a person to appear to save the lost daughter Pain, and the loss of her family since childhood, Allie also needs a person to stand up to guide her in the direction of the future. In this journey, the two people gradually form an interdependent relationship, and perhaps this emotion can only be fully highlighted in a desperate situation, let alone in a world full of despair. From this point of view, both the background and the human settings in the game are almost integrated in a very ingenious way. The plot, human settings and the background form a complementary relationship, which will not only not create a sense of play for the players, but also further deepen the sense of story substitution.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Before the release of last survivor 2, we need to know how great it was/3fd263adad124f1f97e894b8ad933c4d.jpg" alt="Before the release of last survivor 2, we need to know how great it was"><br>Many players will turn on the camera mode unconsciously when they call here<br>    concluding remarks<br>In order to tell a story, they made a game. No matter in plot shaping, plot performance, scene construction or even dubbing and dubbing, the “last survivor” can reach the leading level in the industry at that time. It’s a pity that such a design can’t be made into a movie, but what we need to know is that the video game that can experience is undoubtedly the reason The best way to appreciate things. This kind of story involving human nature and emotion is very easy to impress the audience. If the audience is put into the story together, it will undoubtedly be able to re enlarge the emotional rendering and atmosphere, and it will definitely get a high-quality experience that is several times higher than the movie. For the whole game industry, naughty dogs will undoubtedly promote the movie narrative of the game to a new height again.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Before the release of last survivor 2, we need to know how great it was/d2a452ec88274a4bbfecc323d792435b.jpg" alt="Before the release of last survivor 2, we need to know how great it was"><br>Allie, who always follows Joel, is more like a living existence than an AI. Her impression on the players is no less than that of Elizabeth in biochemist: infinite. Every player who has played “the last survivor” is moved by his touching plot, which is actually one of the models of “the ninth art”. Unfortunately, this work failed to win the best of the year, so his opponent is too strong (gta5). It’s getting closer and closer to the release date of last survivor 2. What kind of emotion can naughty dogs bring to us this time.</p>

For the new generation of players, the games they were born with in their cognition should be like this, while those traditional 2D games have become different. These 2D games, which are still innovating today, are more to show respect for their predecessors. After all, without them, today’s video games will never have such achievements and development.

Even in such a technologically advanced moment, a well-made horizontal version game can still attract many players. For the game field, horizontal game is undoubtedly a very great existence. We may as well reverse the time to see how horizontal game has changed the game field a little over the years.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Breakthrough, update, iteration, horizontal game that never stops evolution/152b3983362b40eb8c553d03733215ec.jpg" alt="Breakthrough, update, iteration, horizontal game that never stops evolution"><br>The fighting scene of Pedro is called “bullet ballet” by players</p>
<h1 id="1970s-to-1980s"><a href="#1970s-to-1980s" class="headerlink" title="1970s to 1980s"></a>1970s to 1980s</h1><p>In 1972, yadali released an arcade game called pong. Although he is not the first game in the world, he is indeed the first game for the public. In order to attract the common people who have not been exposed to this new thing quickly, the game is very simple both in operation and play. There is only one square point and two long white lines in the game picture. The game’s playing method is just like playing table tennis to control the white line to hit the white point. If the other side fails to borrow the white point, it is a failure, and the batsman can get one point. To define its type from the current perspective, it is obvious that pong is a horizontal version of the game, and it is such a simple ping-pong game, but it leads the whole trend of video games.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Breakthrough, update, iteration, horizontal game that never stops evolution/17ee39b6b4964a64bb33805f9e63c0dd.jpg" alt="Breakthrough, update, iteration, horizontal game that never stops evolution"><br>It is worth mentioning that the long strip controlled by players can only move vertically up and down, which is very rare and common in many early video games, such as space invader, centipede, little bee and so on. In these arcade games, players can only move one-dimensional on a straight line. Just a few years later, we have “Pac Man” on the arcade, which can move up, down, left and right. It’s also a game work that nobody knows. Besides the new way of moving, we can also see something different from “Pac Man”: in the past arcade games, we usually like to take “space” as the main body After all, the space is black, so it’s not hard to find that the previous games are all played in a dark dark background, and the game of pac man is actually a designed closed maze, so the concept of “Scene” and “version” has appeared for the first time in the video game. Combined with the two-dimensional movement mode, players can simply interact with the scene Move.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Breakthrough, update, iteration, horizontal game that never stops evolution/d3ae712d672945e8b5a08473f58c7ff7.jpg" alt="Breakthrough, update, iteration, horizontal game that never stops evolution"><br>One year after the birth of “bean eater”, Nintendo launched a arcade game called “King Kong”. In the game, players should play a carpenter with a big nose. The playing method is to control the carpenter to climb up a layer of platform and avoid the obstacles left by King Kong, and finally defeat King Kong to save his girlfriend. In the past, the top view angle of a scene is usually used as a form of expression, so they are not so much horizontal as vertical; however, in King Kong, the side view is used instead, and the purpose of using this view is to make the character “jump”. The climbing platform playing method of “King Kong” is more three-dimensional than before, and the side perspective and jumping have become the standard match of the subsequent horizontal version of the game, so it also derived the branch type of “platform jumping game”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Breakthrough, update, iteration, horizontal game that never stops evolution/4fd2b8ea86a948bbab4a247689776969.jpg" alt="Breakthrough, update, iteration, horizontal game that never stops evolution"><br>In the same year as “King Kong”, a horizontal version of the flying shooting game named “defender” was born. The sound and painting of this game were top-notch at that time. Although the scene is still in the dark night sky, the key point is that the concept of “scroll” was introduced in the design of the game, that is, the scene of the game is not limited to one scene or layout of the previous game, but In a super long map extending horizontally like a scroll, players can move in one direction to drive the scene of the game to roll with it. This sense is like sitting in a car and looking out of the window. But unlike looking out of the window in a car, players can move up and down in four directions at will. Powerful music and painting performance, unprecedented game experience, make the game become the existence of ten thousand people in a time.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Breakthrough, update, iteration, horizontal game that never stops evolution/d829747b1de34a438d1faa22ad0620a5.jpg" alt="Breakthrough, update, iteration, horizontal game that never stops evolution"></p>
<h1 id="1980s-to-1990s"><a href="#1980s-to-1990s" class="headerlink" title="1980s to 1990s"></a>1980s to 1990s</h1><p>Otherwise, in this era when the uprightness game industry broke out, only three years later, Nintendo’s FC home game machine came out, and the way players play is not limited to arcades. As we all know, arcade games usually have score leaderboards, so the playing methods of these games are usually higher than who’s score, and since the game is moved to the home, naturally there are many less competitive consciousness like arcade games to enjoy the game as the main purpose.<br>The hottest game on FC is super Mario Brothers. At first, the carpenter who saved his girlfriend’s big nose in “big King Kong” somehow ate mushrooms to save the princess. His identity changed from a carpenter to a plumber. Although all kinds of settings are very wonderful, scroll games can only drag the version in one direction in order to ensure the richness of the map, but the richness of their levels and imaginative playing methods are very novel, and the “Scene” design has also been upgraded Became “level”, by these two brothers to create the first version of the game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Breakthrough, update, iteration, horizontal game that never stops evolution/a093b39217e9411d8b845f746a663f29.jpg" alt="Breakthrough, update, iteration, horizontal game that never stops evolution"><br>This is a picture with sound<br>Since then, more than 98% of the game works on the home computer platform have passed the level of horizontal version. With the passage of time, many manufacturers pursuing the quality of the game are not willing to use the scroll design. After all, the function is limited. If they want to have better audio-visual effects and scene elements, they need to sacrifice the integrated scroll design.<br>When the scroll is cut off and re spliced, each scene can realize independent operation, and the splicing is no longer limited to the horizontal, which can also make the game map more refined and huge. It seems that each scene is an independent level. Such a design is also convenient for developers to fill other elements in the game, and the new concept “continuous” The world “was born. The classic game Prince of Persia is designed in this way, and the larger map also derived a “non-linear level”, which makes the way to promote the game is not the only one as before.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Breakthrough, update, iteration, horizontal game that never stops evolution/a5f3317049c4438ea187e50f824a1cf4.jpg" alt="Breakthrough, update, iteration, horizontal game that never stops evolution"><br>Complete map of the first pass of Prince of Persia in the early era<br>A variety of designs are constantly superimposed on the horizontal game, and these over advanced designs seem to make the horizontal game reach a bottleneck. I don’t know how the game type can evolve for a while. Since the map of the game is large and the content is much, and the overall quality of the game is enough, why not strengthen the players themselves?<br>Later in the game, we saw a variety of plastic systems, such as changing weapons for the protagonist, adding various auxiliary props, or joining the growth system to learn skills or improve their own attributes. Among them, the representative work is the galaxy Warrior series, which simply means adding the RPG game system next door to the horizontal action game, making the game It’s not only to kill monsters, but also to think about the ways to deal with different environments and enemy players, so that the depth and playability of the game can be improved again. Galaxy warrior has also become the target of many subsequent horizontal action games. At this point, the horizontal version of the action game can be regarded as the basic formation.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Breakthrough, update, iteration, horizontal game that never stops evolution/2199b126436d470eabe515d983473ced.jpg" alt="Breakthrough, update, iteration, horizontal game that never stops evolution"><br>The map elements of the early Galaxy warrior are very rich, rich enough to produce a single strategy book</p>
<h1 id="tail-since-the-‘00’s"><a href="#tail-since-the-‘00’s" class="headerlink" title="tail: since the ‘00’s"></a>tail: since the ‘00’s</h1><p>With the continuous improvement of technology, the quality of video game production is also rising with the tide, while horizontal game has never stopped its evolution. Now that the technology is strong, the screen is not limited to the traditional 2D, you can also use 3D modeling to make scenes and characters, or you can use 3D rendering to enhance the performance of 2D plane. The types and rules of video games are constantly updated, and horizontal games seem to be like a sponge, which can contain various elements and give full play to their characteristics, even if they are added to the construction system, there is no sense of violation.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Breakthrough, update, iteration, horizontal game that never stops evolution/a38dfeee26194e73b0d5b9317014c276.jpg" alt="Breakthrough, update, iteration, horizontal game that never stops evolution"><br>Even if it’s a 2D horizontal edition, teraria can make “the world of others”<br>Up to now, horizontal game still has not stopped its evolution. It can be said that this is a game type with infinite possibilities and creativity. Even in the eyes of most people now, he is a very small group, but it is undeniable that his charm can not be easily covered by other popular fast food games. Just as the so-called wine is not afraid of the deep lane, and the horizontal game is like this jar of fermented wine for a long time, the longer it is, the more fragrant it will be; similarly, this jar of wine is only strong and not easy for everyone to enjoy, the anxious drinking will only make people suddenly come on, and only those who really know how to appreciate will wash their taste and praise it.</p>

    <title>Better game experience Private server the eyesore of online game manufacturers</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>18 years ago, China’s online games rose abruptly. Many games witnessed the changes of China’s game industry and left many happy memories for many players. In the long history of China’s online games, there are many games that have to decline because of many other factors, which is closely related to the emergence of plug-in, but today’s protagonist is not plug-in, but even more vicious than plug-in, that is private server. Up to now, we can see all kinds of private servers of the old game on various web pages, so in the end, what is the private server? Why are so many people willing to play? Why do private servers exist more vicious than plug-ins?</p>
<p>#The rise of private service<br>It is well known that there has always been a cracked piracy in single player games, and the private server is the “piracy” of online games. The private server is the network server that the individual obtains the server installation program and builds without authorization. Its purpose is to divide the game players and make profits from it.<br>Because it’s a personal server, most systems of the game can be modified artificially, which meets the needs that many official game servers can’t meet. For example, if you fill hundreds of pieces in a game, you may just start a low-level VIP, while in the private server, you may have been a high-level member since you started online. Some private servers do not choose to open to the outside world or make profits. Such servers are generally small in scale. They are only assumed in the Internet bar for the purpose of entertainment. It reduces the consumption cost of the game and enjoys better game experience, so private server can attract so many players.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Better game experience Private server the eyesore of online game manufacturers/70b4e7d4efd546e78fa58b0e6a19dd02.jpg" alt="Better game experience Private server the eyesore of online game manufacturers"><br>These “+ 999” and “one knife 999” are also derived from private service<br>Whether it is profitable or not, the existence of private server means that the revenue and flow of official server will be greatly affected, and the market retention rate of game is also very problematic, which is illegal in any case. In the first generation of online games, the most representative work is “Internet creation century” (hereinafter referred to as UO), which is also the first work to appear in the Chinese game market. However, few people know that the game entered the Chinese game market not through the agent operation of Internet manufacturers, but through private services.<br>At that time, the R &amp; D technology of online games was limited, and players who knew a little about the program could tamper with the game code around the world. At that time, no manufacturer in the Chinese market realized that they could make profits through online games. In other words, it was because of the emergence of private online games that manufacturers began to pay attention to the online game industry, but also It is because of the private service that the online game environment at that time was so smoky.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Better game experience Private server the eyesore of online game manufacturers/5ae8ac7fe52c4c9ca34e97a22ed34903.jpg" alt="Better game experience Private server the eyesore of online game manufacturers"><br>The most difficult problem is the language setting of Internet creation</p>
<h1 id="full-explosion"><a href="#full-explosion" class="headerlink" title="full explosion"></a>full explosion</h1><p>In 2000, the king of kings, which originated from Taiwan, entered the mainland of China and became the first graphic online game in the history of Chinese online games and achieved great success. Taking this opportunity, a series of works, such as legend, miracle, Three Kingdoms on the Internet and so on, successively appeared on the market, raising the online games of China to an unprecedented height. At that time, the mainstream online games basically adopted the charging system of point card and monthly card. At that time, not everyone had the conditions to put some money into the game with the consumption level at that time, so to a large extent, many shy young people and student players were dissuaded. They were eager to have free games and could only be addicted through game magazines or TV programs The kind of player is not in the minority, but also is to see this point, then appeared above in the Internet bar, not for the purpose of profit-making private server.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Better game experience Private server the eyesore of online game manufacturers/a960a12288174949ba3c2744c0dc977e.jpg" alt="Better game experience Private server the eyesore of online game manufacturers"><br>Although it seems that the picture of king of Kings is simple now, it carried the memories of countless people at that time<br>In the middle of 2002, the Italian server program of legendary, a classic online game from South Korea, was accidentally leaked. After entering China, the private service of legendary spread at an explosive speed. In less than half a year, about 500 private services could be found on the market to operate at the same time. These private servers have low charges, high explosion rate and fast upgrade, and are favored by players who fail to get a good experience in the official server.<br>Private server absorbed the water of the players in the official uniform of legend. The most uncomfortable one was Shanda network, which was responsible for the agency work in China. The players were seriously separated, and Shanda could only stand on one side and was helpless. Later, Shanda also tore his face. He refused to pay the share of the game on the ground that the Korean developers could not solve the technical problems, and ran away with the money he earned. Therefore, legend declined, and the company relationship between China and South Korea was completely broken.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Better game experience Private server the eyesore of online game manufacturers/667065c0daf34e63b77f9f09b2c8e951.jpg" alt="Better game experience Private server the eyesore of online game manufacturers"><br>Nowadays, the private servers of legend are mainly page tours<br>Taking this incident as an opportunity, many people have taken a fancy to the revenue capacity of private service, so there is such a gray industry chain in the places outside the law. There are special people who are responsible for stealing the service end or source code of the game. If they can’t steal it, they will edit it by themselves according to the gourd gourd gourd ladle. These people will put the compiled programs on the Internet for sale, and those who intend to buy these services only need to pay money It’s a game private server with a fool’s server building tutorial, which can modify the game parameters by itself. The lowering of the threshold for building a private server means that more games have launched private servers one after another, and even many unexpected games have private servers, such as world of Warcraft, League of heroes, watch vanguard and even Jedi survive The service comprehensively optimizes the existing problems such as balance or playability in the official service, and constantly introduces new content, so many private services are even more popular than the official service.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Better game experience Private server the eyesore of online game manufacturers/67d692ea623f4308892ab6e80b66a89a.jpg" alt="Better game experience Private server the eyesore of online game manufacturers"><br>Imagine landing on the ground with three-level head AWM’s Jedi survival, which is probably the feeling (funny)</p>
<p>#How to deal with private services<br>Most manufacturers hold the same attitude of cracking down on private service as plug-in service. After all, this is a kind of existence that does not melt into the official and legal provisions. As early as 2016, the biggest nostalgic private service of world of Warcraft, nostalrius (n-service for short), was sued by Blizzard, the developer of world of Warcraft, saying that private service infringed the rights and interests of official service, demanded to claim and stop service, and won the lawsuit successfully. This event triggered the dissatisfaction of nearly 150000 people in N-Server and 100000 people who loved nostalgic service, and a total of 250000 players.<br>This amazing number of people surprised blizzard. Even the elders who once made ancient versions killed back to Blizzard’s headquarters and asked for nostalgic clothes to be opened. In the face of this situation, the senior officials were also thoughtful about this, so he invited the producers of n-clothes to negotiate with other private server managers. After many market surveys and discussions, Blizzard decided to launch their own clothes Although the quality of the official nostalgic clothes is poor, it still appeases the dissatisfaction of the players.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Better game experience Private server the eyesore of online game manufacturers/6b6f4cd662c74d8fa1bff3c5cc8d292f.jpg" alt="Better game experience Private server the eyesore of online game manufacturers"><br>Although it is private service, the game environment of n-service is thriving<br>There is no absoluteness, and not everyone thinks so. There is such a person who is completely open to private servers. He is g Pang. He is almost indifferent to the private server (called community service and platform in the game) of his own game “csgo”. Moreover, the server of official service only has 64 ticks (data transmission speed per second), but the server of the platform has 128 ticks. G fat doesn’t need to change the server’s money, but even if it doesn’t change, it can have a better experience and doesn’t affect the game. The box should be opened, the accessories should be bought, and what’s the fun Why not?<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Better game experience Private server the eyesore of online game manufacturers/fa672af4ae474d419fe4ffe7dc8959b9.jpg" alt="Better game experience Private server the eyesore of online game manufacturers"><br>There are many hidden sub-systems on the platform that the official server does not have<br>    concluding remarks<br>The continuous emergence of private server also shows that there are various or big or small problems in the current online game environment. It may be that the game balance is not good, the charges may be unreasonable, or the game content may be too scarce. If the developers deal with the operation of the game properly, how can there be so many private servers? If the game made by the government can’t compare with private service, what is the persuasive force to fight against private service?<br>However, I’d like to remind you that although the experience of private service may be better than that of the official, it is illegal in the gray area in any case unless it’s official approval, and it’s far less than the official in terms of security and service, so I don’t recommend you to try private service.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>Some time ago, the new work “dead and stranded” by Hideki Oshima, a famous star producer who left Konami manufacturer in Japan, finally released a 9-minute-long Trailer under the public’s attention. Hideki Oshima said that the whole trailer is a real machine rendered picture. From the trailer, we can see that Hideki Oshima used his favorite cinematic expression method in this work. No Whether it’s the movement of each lens or the expression of each passage, it reveals a breath of literary and art movies, giving people the illusion of watching a CG movie.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Blizzard is not the only CG factory players are talking about/a8e89a72172647e78e27fb38b75b66b1.jpg" alt="Blizzard is not the only CG factory players are talking about"><br>The personal style of the island is vividly reflected in “stranded in death”<br>In 1993, the science fiction adventure movie Jurassic Park directed by Spielberg came into being. All kinds of dinosaurs in the movie were made with CG synthetic special effects, which gave people a kind of visual experience based on falsehood and truth. It once shocked the global film industry and was called “a miracle of the film age”. In the blink of an eye, it is no longer fresh to use CG special effect technology in all kinds of sci-fi films nowadays. However, as a latecomer, video games stand out in the competition of a group of film and television special effects by relying on the flexible use of CG technology. Nowadays, many game manufacturers can even create CG trailers for the game to compete with many films. What’s more, they can directly use CG technology to play the game Make it into a movie to realize the cross-border three-dimensional game experience.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Blizzard is not the only CG factory players are talking about/777a081221c146868bba3983b3a467f1.jpg" alt="Blizzard is not the only CG factory players are talking about"><br>T-Rex’s debut was too classic</p>
<h1 id="ten-years-for-games-nine-years-for-CG"><a href="#ten-years-for-games-nine-years-for-CG" class="headerlink" title="ten years for games, nine years for CG"></a>ten years for games, nine years for CG</h1><p>Speaking of the “CG factory” in the game industry, the first reaction of players from all walks of life must be blizzard, a game manufacturer from the United States. The game CG or animation launched by Blizzard can always deeply shock the players. It is a common thing for players to tease each other, “Blizzard’s trailer can always see the visual sense of the blockbuster” or “an animation company delayed by the game”.<br>As early as 1994, Blizzard began to use CG animation in its own games. At that time, the game manufacturers basically liked to use the form of live performance to make the game to save costs, while only a few manufacturers with real money dare to make CG. When Blizzard’s own game “Warcraft” was launched in the early generation, although he had money in his hand, he was still a novice, and his production experience still needs to be improved. In the game, a large number of single long lens CG are used, but for a manufacturer who just tries to do it, it’s a very incredible degree.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Blizzard is not the only CG factory players are talking about/98bad4df35d0494e82bd1a353f23de0f.jpg" alt="Blizzard is not the only CG factory players are talking about"><br>Stormwind city in the early CG of Warcraft<br>If we say that the early animation is not mature in all aspects, then we will tune the time back to the “Warcraft 3” period, which is only 8 years away from the initial issue. At this point, Blizzard’s CG debut in the game has already been ranked the first tier in the industry. The scenes and lines of many scenic spots have left a deep impression on the players.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Blizzard is not the only CG factory players are talking about/9532be2b5e3545b09edda2e86df46b7e.jpg" alt="Blizzard is not the only CG factory players are talking about"><br>Lordaeron in CG of Warcraft 3<br>Generally in the game industry, CG animation production is outsourced to other studios, while Blizzard has set up a special animation production department within the company. These people may be Blizzard fans or co creators, but all kinds of talents are needed by blizzard. By the time of world of Warcraft, the animation production department has already To reach the scale of 100 people, the opening animation of “world of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King” only took 3 minutes to burn 20 million dollars. It’s OK to use this money to develop another game. Why does Blizzard do this? The reason is very simple. They just want to make the story of the game more profound. Although Blizzard’s game may not be satisfactory in content, at least we have animation chat to comfort us.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Blizzard is not the only CG factory players are talking about/1e8adcf423924d72938d4f62c0bd6642.jpg" alt="Blizzard is not the only CG factory players are talking about"><br>“Watch the vanguard” CG animation “Double Dragons” once sealed Blizzard</p>
<h1 id="do-CG-with-heart-and-play-games-with-feet"><a href="#do-CG-with-heart-and-play-games-with-feet" class="headerlink" title="do CG with heart and play games with feet"></a>do CG with heart and play games with feet</h1><p>When you see this title, there may be some ambiguities among players from all walks of life. This name can be used to refer to many game manufacturers, which have a common feature: after you watch the films they broadcast, you will definitely want to buy their games, but after you buy them, you feel deeply cheated. But it is estimated that if we can make a statistics, the voice of Ubisoft from France will be the highest. Earlier, Ubisoft relied on the game of “Assassin’s Creed” to publicize CG, which was eye-catching for the new IP. An assassin in a white hooded robe walked on the eaves of a medieval building, revealing a feeling of “cool, cooler, cooler” from the bone.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Blizzard is not the only CG factory players are talking about/2bfd2c5ad6a24b9abc347ecc2f67f9ec.jpg" alt="Blizzard is not the only CG factory players are talking about"><br>It’s estimated that the most classic scene in the minds of Assassin’s Creed fans is the scene of “thousands of troops avoid white robes”<br>In addition to the assassin’s creed, Ubisoft’s other games also have CG trailers that are extremely popular. Many of these trailers are regarded as classic works by players, and their sophistication has won many awards for Ubisoft, such as “best game marketing”, “best publicity video”, etc. But because the CG is too sophisticated, when players get the real game, they discover that the game is not good enough to cause a great sense of difference. The voice of Tucao Ubisoft “CG is too handsome and the game is too bad” is endless. It makes people wonder whether Ubisoft has used the budget to make CG.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Blizzard is not the only CG factory players are talking about/7f2ec245f74c450783320dc43559959c.jpg" alt="Blizzard is not the only CG factory players are talking about"><br>The CG of Assassin’s Creed: the revolution is exciting, but the quality of the game is poor<br>Fortunately, after encountering the same problems in one game after another, Ubisoft seems to be relatively convergent in terms of game publicity. The trailer of the game usually uses the real machine demonstration screen of the game, and the publicity intensity is also low-key. In recent years, the game quality of Ubisoft has been significantly improved compared with that before. It seems that the industry has reached a period when CG animation is not needed. For the real game picture, players can be more or less confident when they purchase.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Blizzard is not the only CG factory players are talking about/e00ace2750aa4fdba636e49643a81e89.jpg" alt="Blizzard is not the only CG factory players are talking about"><br>There are only one or two CG previews in “whole territory blockade 2”, and the rest are real pictures</p>
<h1 id="“our-CG-ranks-first-in-the-world-”"><a href="#“our-CG-ranks-first-in-the-world-”" class="headerlink" title="“our CG ranks first in the world!”"></a>“our CG ranks first in the world!”</h1><p>It is often said that “blizzard in the west, Se in the East”. When it comes to CG technology, how can we not mention this Japanese manufacturer, skwell Enix, who is almost paranoid about the picture requirements. Apart from the game industry, se is well-known even in the whole CG technology field. As early as when se hasn’t been merged, square has joined CG in her own final fantasy series since 1994’s final fantasy 6. As mentioned above, in order to save costs, manufacturers at that time generally used live performance to produce live performance. However, the series of final fantasy has a second-order and different world style, so it’s not necessary to make a B-class film in the form of live performance, so first With or without money, CG must be used.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Blizzard is not the only CG factory players are talking about/44c05cfc14254de9a1a93175f631c292.jpg" alt="Blizzard is not the only CG factory players are talking about"><br>Final fantasy 6’s CG has reached the highest standard in the game industry<br>In 1997, Sakamoto, the father of final fantasy, planned to shoot a long CG movie with final fantasy. At that time, the cost of playing games with CG was very high, let alone making a movie with CG for more than an hour. For this reason, scowell began to issue a large number of new shares, using more than 1000 computers and more than 200 people to jointly produce. The development took more than three years, with a total cost of about 140 million. What is the 140 million concept? In 2008, the total number of robots filmed by Disney was only 180 million. It can be imagined that the 140 million around 2000 is a terrible number.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Blizzard is not the only CG factory players are talking about/205d4173c25344f7af3a8ac51ea30b64.jpg" alt="Blizzard is not the only CG factory players are talking about"><br>At that time, the picture of “Final Fantasy: deep soul” had the capital to span two generations<br>The level of sophistication of the final fantasy: deep in the soul is not out of date even now. Scowell put his family background on the film, and if he doesn’t succeed, he will become benevolent. Sure enough, the box office of the movie failed miserably. If it wasn’t for Sony’s help to merge with Enix, scowell would have gone bankrupt. Despite the failure, Se after the reorganization was not discouraged, but more “intensified”. They were almost paranoid about CG technology, and successively made two films with “Final Fantasy”.<br>In 2005, the final fantasy 7: the son of God comes has the same quality as other Hollywood films in terms of both screen and performance techniques. However, the quality of the final fantasy 15: the sword of the king, if not CG, would be considered as a real person, but on the plot depth, there has been no obvious progress. Most of the time, these films are like the extra plot D of the game LC, and you have to go to the cinema to experience it. It’s more appropriate to describe SE’s CG movie with “jinyuqibiao”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Blizzard is not the only CG factory players are talking about/6274896c218c4c6faaca1a1445c2e05f.jpg" alt="Blizzard is not the only CG factory players are talking about"><br>The modeling of characters in the sword of the king is the same as real people<br>    concluding remarks<br>Whether it’s the film industry or the game industry, CG technology is really a big hit, but also an important element to determine whether a work can attract the eye. However, it should be admitted that CG is from the relationship with the master in the game, which means that an excellent CG work is born to serve the game itself and make it better. Similarly, CG is not essential for games. It can be but is not necessary. It seems that there are not many manufacturers who can accurately grasp this position in the whole industry. For the sophisticated paranoia, it may ruin their future. In my opinion, instead of trying to make excellent animation for the game, why not just go straight What about animation?</p>

    <title>Can players accept the game manufacturer&#39;s mending the past</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/Can%20players%20accept%20the%20game%20manufacturer&#39;s%20mending%20the%20past/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Nowadays, there are countless types and styles of video games. There are many excellent works, and there are more unsatisfactory works. However, there are many works that gradually become a good one through updating and modifying because of the poor quality of the game at the beginning. This situation usually means that many works fail at the beginning, and game manufacturers attempt to recover the reputation and quality of the game through these remedies. After all, for large factories, if the game has no reputation, it means that they cannot create revenue, and especially for many large factories, no one wants to see their hard-made products do not earn money.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Can players accept the game manufacturer's mending the past/9a00320e24294250a252666abb764fa4.jpg" alt="Can players accept the game manufacturer&#39;s mending the past"><br>With the passage of time, this kind of situation happens more and more often. It always gives people a feeling of “they are all good in collusion”. As time goes on, it will not be surprising. Let’s think about it from another angle. If there are still so many similar situations under the condition of having learned from the past, then what is the reason? And players are willing to accept the developers every time “know what’s wrong and change it”?</p>
<h1 id="helpless-move"><a href="#helpless-move" class="headerlink" title="helpless move"></a>helpless move</h1><p>In my impression, the first successful case of “saltfish turning over” should be the action shooting game “warframe” launched by digital extremes (DE), a Canadian developer. The original “warframe” only has three battle armours and a few maps for players to play, but for a free online game, it seems that the head is not well opened. In its early years, de was mainly responsible for undertaking various outsourcing projects and developing other games for many first-line manufacturers. The studio’s earliest achievements can be traced back to the last century’s “virtual arena” series. With the passage of time, the development technology of the game is becoming more and more demanding, and De is constantly expanding its scale in order to better complete the task. In the hearts of several core members of the studio, they have been thinking that one day they can make a large-scale original work of their own. In order to realize the whole dream, they have tried many times, but failed in the end It ended.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Can players accept the game manufacturer's mending the past/1315830f4bd643cfa55b03778765b365.jpg" alt="Can players accept the game manufacturer&#39;s mending the past"><br>However, with the business of the studio becoming more and more sluggish and the special “humanistic care” of Canadians, even though the company has almost been unable to make ends meet, it will not actively dismiss any employees. They will integrate the only resources in their hands and decide to make a game to save the miserable situation of the studio. If the game still fails, then The studio is likely to be completely dissolved.<br>And this game is warframe. The reason why the first version of the game is so low is that their ability can only achieve this level at that time, and many aspects of the design are also very immature. At the beginning of the online game, many people have criticized the game, but people can see clearly that this game has a good foundation and great potential, so they decided to give Support. With the help of the players, “warframe” can have today’s huge scale and good reputation. It can be said that this road is not the one that De is willing to choose, they just have no choice but to do so.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Can players accept the game manufacturer's mending the past/0ad55694b27940a8b44104ae0c325ddf.jpg" alt="Can players accept the game manufacturer&#39;s mending the past"></p>
<p>#A cavity of hot blood<br>When it comes to “saltfish turning over”, how can we not mention the famous name of “Final Fantasy 14” (ff14 for short), “square Enix” (Se for short), the developer of FF series, is also a front-line manufacturer in the circle, holding many world-class well-known IPS? For such a company, it is certainly not necessary to worry about money, even if the game is done in general, it can also Rely on hard technology to save a bit of public praise. But who can think that even with such superior conditions, Se can still make a “garbage” to smash its own signboard. “Ff14” is the second online game in the history of the series, and the quality of the previous generation’s works is pretty good and still insists on operation until today. Perhaps for se at that time, the “Final Fantasy” series was the “ceiling” of Japanese games at that time, in terms of technology The ability to do the best, or even just that, is enough for players to volunteer to pay.<br>Driven by this concept, Se developed ff14 online game in a 3A single player mode. Due to the confusion of concepts, the game is neither like a single player nor an online game. In addition to the screen, it is useless and does not consider the configuration of players in terms of optimization. As a result, the first version of the game has no gameplay. It is not so much an online game as an online game A demonstration product for se to show muscle.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Can players accept the game manufacturer's mending the past/e522203c800f4ac0bc593856bfa76423.jpg" alt="Can players accept the game manufacturer&#39;s mending the past"><br>Se is like a child who doesn’t know what to do. Only when he has really suffered a loss can he learn a lesson. “Ff14” has been hit by Waterloo online. Many fans can’t help but cry out to be cheated when they see the game like this. Several core members who once led the team to develop the game just quit the farce after apologizing. In se, Yoshida, who is the next door producer of “the brave fight the dragon”, took over the mess.<br>Yoshida likes FF series very much. He has a chance to take over the development he is working on, but he didn’t expect it to be like this. He doesn’t want to see the IP die slowly. He wants to make the series fresh again. So he decides to make a new game to replace the existing version. Throughout the history of the game, the only game that can do this is ff14. Now, the word-of-mouth of ff14 is not only the highest in the series, but also its influence is gradually expanding. All this is due to Yoshida’s love for this work. They are not short of money, they are only short of enthusiasm for these works.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Can players accept the game manufacturer's mending the past/c57f80ee8b1a459e8a4744c1b4698b80.jpg" alt="Can players accept the game manufacturer&#39;s mending the past"></p>
<h1 id="experimental-products"><a href="#experimental-products" class="headerlink" title="experimental products"></a>experimental products</h1><p>There are two online games on the top, but there are some differences on the bottom. I don’t know if you have found out that many big factories like to launch various “service-oriented Games” nowadays. They sell 3A price of the game and promise that there will be continuous updates after the game goes online, so that players can always have new things to play. In this way, they can not only get profits from the game sale, but also maintain the stickiness of the players through the update, so as to sell various kinds of clothes Decorative props and service projects to long-term profitability. Usually these games will announce the future update plan of the game at the beginning of sale as a gimmick to publicize the game. In most cases, these updates do not have accurate date and detailed content, and often only have one concept and one name, but actually to the extreme of the update, they are delayed again and again. In this regard, to a large extent, it is the table after the sale of the game Now related. Such as EA’s “hymn” and Bethesda’s “radiation 76” and other works, these games are full of gimmicks in the early stage of the sale, attracting the attention of players with shocking trailers, but when the game is sold, it is found that it is another scene.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Can players accept the game manufacturer's mending the past/85e084c0feb7416294d97761534773ba.jpg" alt="Can players accept the game manufacturer&#39;s mending the past"><br>For these first-line manufacturers, they also don’t need to worry about money. Why do they want to publicize and make great efforts to emphasize the future update plan? Because they know what the first version of these games looks like. After all, these manufacturers have had successful works before, and they know better and worse than anyone, And the birth of these games is often a flash of inspiration or have been put on hold of the idea of useless, by the “service-oriented game” boom to do a rub heat.<br>The more self-confident you are about your game, the more you will emphasize which parts of the game are excellent. The development cycle of these games is much shorter than the players think. Blow the cow out first, and slowly add in the missing content after the game is sold. If the market reaction is not good, you can even give up the operation of the game. For a few manufacturers with bad reputation, the update will definitely be more. It’s just a matter of time. After all, they have to rely on their reputation to eat. And some people just can let go of this face, and you can’t do anything about it even if you don’t do it. What about you, ff15.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Can players accept the game manufacturer's mending the past/73e33df518d94ad0b3695ade118b07b6.jpg" alt="Can players accept the game manufacturer&#39;s mending the past"><br>    concluding remarks<br>Since talking about this topic, many people may wonder how they can not talk about “no one in deep space”? Because the situation of “no one in deep space” is quite special, because he is the combination of “warframe” and “ff14” in the above, the producers have a dream to enjoy the universe, and also hope to try their best to return to the Haikou they once boasted, and they have experienced the flood during the development period, resulting in the loss of data, even if the reputation of the game is poor, the reputation of the studio is still poor Adhere to the game updates, and are free. Don’t forget that they are still an independent game development team, which is absolutely impossible for many front-line manufacturers.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Can players accept the game manufacturer's mending the past/04b79ae3567d43d4a795d8c4bb361232.jpg" alt="Can players accept the game manufacturer&#39;s mending the past"><br>Now, the quality of “no one in deep space” is enough to make people forget the “scam” he once caused. On the other hand, if the first-line manufacturers fail to achieve the expected results in the first game and internal purchase, and where the motivation continues to provide long-term free updates for the game, perhaps in their view, this is a kind of behavior of “no effort, no favor”. Most of the time, the players don’t care when the game is updated or how much it can be updated, but they care about the attitude of the development team towards their own works. Only with their loyalty to the players and enthusiasm for the game, will there be a piece of Nirvana reborn works. For those who see unprofitable works and try to give up, they will eventually bear a bad reputation and be forgotten In the long river of time.</p>

However, it must be noted that the Lost Castle mobile game has a large number of random elements. Sometimes these random elements can be deceiving and mismatching. Minutes are faster than single brush<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Count the players in the game world! It's more terrible than boss.

All kinds of super giant boss give players the most intense sense of tension and stimulation. After defeating boss, they can get rich rewards! If you like to challenge high difficulty players, it is recommended to try this game!</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>With the growth of people’s age, all kinds of troubles and pressures fill every day of our life. There is little time for us to put down our work and have a good rest, as if there are fewer and fewer things that can bring us happiness in life. When I was a kid, we could enjoy a simple paper plane or a few colorful cards. And the cartoons that make us most happy are those that we can’t forget today. Animation can bring different influences to everyone’s growth, but our leading role today, cat and mouse, is the one with the greatest influence.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Cat and mouse is probably the favorite CP of all childhood/dc47411e430b4f8a8f4fb71ff6ee31fe.jpg" alt="Cat and mouse is probably the favorite CP of all childhood"><br>In the early years, whether in animation or literary works, “mouse” always appeared as a villain, representing evil and cunning. The cat, which is just opposite to it, must be a symbol of justice, courage and wisdom. Chinese audiences who are used to watching “Sheriff black cat” and then turn to watch “cat and mouse” from other countries will surely wonder how the positions of the cat and mouse are completely reversed? It may be said that Disney’s Mickey Mouse is also a positive image of the mouse, but there is no cat in Mickey Mouse. Even in such a situation, cat and mouse still obsesses the children so much that they forget to eat and sleep, even when their snot drips onto the stool.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Cat and mouse is probably the favorite CP of all childhood/48088f73d44d4d21b9a1777932e9a767.jpg" alt="Cat and mouse is probably the favorite CP of all childhood"><br>The most famous villain mouse image is the “one ear” in Sheriff black cat</p>

The first animation of the series was born in 1940, and was produced and released by Metro Goldwyn Mayer (MGM), one of the eight major Hollywood film companies. Although it was born early, it was officially introduced to the mainland of China in the 1980s and is well known to us on the other side of the ocean. Although MGM film company is rarely mentioned at present, it has been a great power at that time. Their logo is believed that most people will not feel strange, that is, the lion surrounded by a circle of film and roaring a few times before the film starts.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Cat and mouse is probably the favorite CP of all childhood/0c413b4f5b5f4752b40b9d973b6187b2.jpg" alt="Cat and mouse is probably the favorite CP of all childhood"><br>That’s what you thought it was<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Cat and mouse is probably the favorite CP of all childhood/23428de792974d6094e5a5535da41a29.jpg" alt="Cat and mouse is probably the favorite CP of all childhood"><br>Actually, it’s like this. Lions have strict training and don’t hurt people<br>A year before the first episode of cat and mouse, director William Hannah and Joseph Barbera were planning to launch a new animation, which was not the first collaboration between the two men, who had previously CO produced an animated film called “galloping girl” (about horses). The two plan to set the protagonists of the animation as “cat” and “mouse” to show a series of comic effects with the conflict between them. After the first episode is finished, the two will name the cat “Jasper” and the mouse “jinx”.<br>For some reason, before the animation was released, the two men deleted the name of mouse jinks. After all, according to the logic of reality, the name of domestic cat will definitely be named by the owner, while the name of the mouse hidden in the home will never be named by anyone. In February 1940, the first episode of the series was officially released in the cinema. This animated short film is called “push gets the boot”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Cat and mouse is probably the favorite CP of all childhood/c6caea6f1f7a4f7fbe68c667907da145.jpg" alt="Cat and mouse is probably the favorite CP of all childhood"><br>At first, the design of a cat was more like a real cat than a cartoon character<br>At first, the production team didn’t plan to make follow-up works, and even didn’t attach any importance to the series. However, due to the unprecedented popularity after the release, the company realized that the animation was actually a potential stock, with great value to be explored, so the company opened a green light for the creation of the animation. At this time, they suddenly think of a question: since they are going to make a formal production, does the character always have a name? So we decided the names of the two roles by the way of internal bidding, and finally named them “Tom” and “Jerry”. Since then, we are familiar with the role images.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Cat and mouse is probably the favorite CP of all childhood/24aa4e05641249109a65acf40365825b.jpg" alt="Cat and mouse is probably the favorite CP of all childhood"><br>Over the years, the production team of cat and mouse has changed again and again, and the characters’ images have also changed again and again</p>
<p>#The animation is short and original<br>Each episode of cat and mouse is very short, only about 10 minutes, but we can clearly feel the producer’s intention. The fluency of animation is very high. Almost every frame is a different picture. At the same time, the imagination of the plot is boundless. You can never imagine what will happen next second. There are not many actual sound effects in the animation. Each action and behavior of the character is replaced by orchestral music with different melody. For example, when the character bumps into the wall, it will be expressed with clear gongs When chasing, we will use the large and small bugles with rapid rhythm to express, which makes the overall appearance very powerful.<br>After the first episode of animation broadcast, in the following 18 years, MGM launched 114 episodes of “cat and mouse” animated short films. During this period, MGM has won more than ten Oscar nominations for best animated short films, seven of which have won awards successfully. At that time, almost no one can shake such an award, even the senior Disney at that time did not have such treatment.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Cat and mouse is probably the favorite CP of all childhood/fcbed67d0a9544a8b8d9f2349c8e4523.jpg" alt="Cat and mouse is probably the favorite CP of all childhood"><br>The production team made no secret of putting the honors in the title of the animation<br>All the audience friends who have seen the cartoon should know that although Tom and Jerry are dead rivals in the cartoon, it is common for them to fight openly and secretly, and they will choose to cooperate when necessary. Besides the fight, they are also good friends with deep friendship. They will feel sad and lonely for each other’s leaving. The audience likes this cartoon not only because it can bring We have all kinds of jokes, but how can such a pair of CP who are also enemies, friends, love and kill each other not be liked by people? Animation is accompanied by a little warmth at the same time of funny. Although it is a simple and clear funny animation, it does not lose the connotation of a work of education and entertainment.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Cat and mouse is probably the favorite CP of all childhood/3c713398a4a04a60be12c70743662df8.jpg" alt="Cat and mouse is probably the favorite CP of all childhood"></p>
<h1 id="video-games-for-the-regular-meeting"><a href="#video-games-for-the-regular-meeting" class="headerlink" title="video games for the regular meeting"></a>video games for the regular meeting</h1><p>In that era, the popular idea of a film and television work was that it would surely attract the attention of other fields, and then it would also drive a wave of hot sales of peripheral products, children’s story books, toys, clothing, shoes and hats, etc. emerge in an endless stream, and naturally there would be no shortage of video games. The high popularity of animation has been maintained until the emergence of FC red and white machine, and the adaptation game of cat and mouse has naturally logged into FC.<br>The game “cat and mouse” on FC is just like the cartoon. There are only two roles to play the opponent’s play, and the development team of the game is only two people. Therefore, the production of the game is relatively simple. The playing method of the game is to pass the horizontal version. The players only need to play Jerry’s cheese collection to defeat Tom. Although there are many scenes honoring the cartoon, the quality of the game The quantity is not very satisfactory.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Cat and mouse is probably the favorite CP of all childhood/12bbe28776bc4269b209cdb33a14e916.jpg" alt="Cat and mouse is probably the favorite CP of all childhood"><br>The color matching in the game is very strange. It’s dazzling after watching for a long time<br>One of the more well-known works is the PC based fighting game released by Ubisoft in 2002. Different from the previous cat and mouse game, Tom and Jerry in this game are finally able to compete fairly. Players and opponents can use various props and objects to attack each other in a closed environment. This style of throwing things and taking weapons to fight is similar to “Nintendo star fights”. Because this work supports local doubles, it was also popular at that time and favored by many small players.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Cat and mouse is probably the favorite CP of all childhood/eb7686021ec547178244e2146407d526.jpg" alt="Cat and mouse is probably the favorite CP of all childhood"><br>Scene restoration is quite high, but the modeling of characters is not flattering<br>At present, Netease, a domestic company, has launched a derivative mobile game named “cat and mouse” on the mobile platform. To be honest, the first impression of IP adapted games is not very good in the prevailing trend of consumer sentiment. Therefore, it is inevitable to worry about whether the content will be strange. The hand game end is neither a horizontal board game nor a fighting game. At first, Netease planned to launch a horizontal version of Parkour game in the design, but later added an asymmetric confrontation mode. Compared with the previous one-to-one game, the new mode is more noisy.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Cat and mouse is probably the favorite CP of all childhood/5f1031a2a9b049b58bb7473a66a82b50.jpg" alt="Cat and mouse is probably the favorite CP of all childhood"><br>In the game, players play either 4-to-1 rats or 1-to-4 cats. Rats collect cheese and take out houses, while cats expel rats. In fact, it is quite interesting to combine the IP of “cat and mouse” with “killing chickens”. In a word, it is the best work of IP’s overall quality so far.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Cat and mouse is probably the favorite CP of all childhood/f0f6f758f1024dca8571225871189a1c.jpg" alt="Cat and mouse is probably the favorite CP of all childhood"><br>Whether it’s adults or children, this noisy game is perfect<br>    concluding remarks<br>Time flies, we are no longer young, and the happy time of sitting in front of the computer with friends holding half of the keyboard to play each other has long gone, and “cat and mouse” is 80 years old, no longer favored by children today. Back to the topic at the beginning of our article, we can easily get happiness from some simple things in childhood, which is particularly easy to be satisfied. Now, looking back, we have to worry about the living expenses of this month while talking about our childishness at that time.<br>Time will never stop passing. Maybe it’s not your intention to step into this noisy society, but it must be life’s forced helplessness. We are old, they are old, we should think about the problems that the adults should think about, but I believe that in everyone’s heart, the one who was full of happy smile will always exist.</p>

    <title>Craig studio, the successor of CRPG who is more brave and fearless</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/Craig%20studio,%20the%20successor%20of%20CRPG%20who%20is%20more%20brave%20and%20fearless/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>As early as the end of May, a picture similar to the Roman numeral “Ⅲ” appeared on the official website of Larian studios, the developer of the God level CRPG game “god world: original sin” series. So far, two works have been launched. Seeing that the official sends a “Ⅲ” will surely take it for granted that they want to produce “god world: original sin 3”, In an instant, it ignited the enthusiasm of many players who like the series of “God: original sin”.<br>But calm down and think about it carefully. Two months ago, Larian studio just announced that a derivative work called “god world: Hero’s second coming” is under development. How could it be possible to separate some people from Larian’s scale to make the orthodox sequel “god world: original sin 3”?<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Craig studio, the successor of CRPG who is more brave and fearless/507588a91c274cbe8de7e30a33fad483.jpg" alt="Craig studio, the successor of CRPG who is more brave and fearless"><br>As expected, things are not so simple, not that their manpower is not enough, but that the “cake” seems to be bigger than we think. Earlier this month, studio Laran announced the true identity of the new work, a more tearful Name: bode’s gate 3.<br>As a CRPG enthusiast, I believe that many people are as happy as I am, but for most people, it seems that the door of Bode is a very strange name, which is not a strange thing. After all, the release of the new work is nearly 19 years since the release of the previous work, door of Bode 2, but our protagonist is not bode The door, but plans to develop its Larian studio.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Craig studio, the successor of CRPG who is more brave and fearless/d8fde0488aae4e45b28b12fa9d276f02.jpg" alt="Craig studio, the successor of CRPG who is more brave and fearless"></p>
<h1 id="bad-timing"><a href="#bad-timing" class="headerlink" title="bad timing"></a>bad timing</h1><p>No matter from which point of view, CRPG’s hard core system settings and traditional miscellaneous game playing methods can’t please most players, but there is no doubt that CRPG games represented by the “divine world: original sin” series are no longer popular in the game market, but without them, the situation of CRPG may not be as good as it is now.<br>All the way with CRPG to the current Belgian studio Larian is also so erratic. At first, their studio scale was only three people. Since their establishment in 1996, they wanted to make an RPG game. At first, they wanted to sell this game to yadali. Relying on yadali’s fame, they hoped that the game could be exposed in the whole region to improve sales.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Craig studio, the successor of CRPG who is more brave and fearless/0481b8fefcaa44de955d52ffdb64769d.jpg" alt="Craig studio, the successor of CRPG who is more brave and fearless"><br>At that time, yadali was synonymous with video games<br>But who knows that it’s just in time for yadali to withdraw from the game world due to the serious frustration of the E.T. Laran is so stupid that he can’t sell the game to anyone without his owner? Without distributors, the development funds have become a big problem, and the development prospect of the game is worrying. At the same time, attic entertainment, a publisher from Germany, expressed its willingness to pay for them and take charge of the distribution work, and was able to obtain the copyright of “dark eyes”, one of the RPG rules very popular in Germany.<br>It’s good to have new rules, but it means that they have to redo the game in order to apply this set of rules, but the price offered by the developers is appropriate. Although they may be tired, they agree, and the size of the studio has also increased to 30 people, and the game to overthrow the redo is called the lady, the mage and the knight.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Craig studio, the successor of CRPG who is more brave and fearless/b46a2a9e262944fb889b3697c70a9644.jpg" alt="Craig studio, the successor of CRPG who is more brave and fearless"><br>The story of yadali’s collapse is unprecedented</p>
<h1 id="several-turns-in-a-wave"><a href="#several-turns-in-a-wave" class="headerlink" title="several turns in a wave"></a>several turns in a wave</h1><p>Who could have expected that there would be some unexpected events. The sales volume of other games issued by attic, the publisher, failed to meet the expectation, which made them unable to invest more money in Larian. This was very embarrassing. Half of the owners of the game went bankrupt, and the development of the game consumed their own money, so they had to cancel the development of the game, and began to accept the outsourcing work to make a living, At the same time, we need to support the publisher attic.<br>At the same time of outsourcing, they plan to develop a new game and find a new publisher for the game, which is “divine divinity”. Originally, I thought everything could go according to the plan. Who knows that there was a moth on the way. The developers asked them to put the game on the market ahead of time, but at this time, the game was not even finished (like a K Club).<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Craig studio, the successor of CRPG who is more brave and fearless/d5ac9d02dea54a719f41be4204e0e3a9.jpg" alt="Craig studio, the successor of CRPG who is more brave and fearless"><br>Many contents of the divine Kingdom pay homage to his predecessor and old enemy, Diablo II<br>Sure enough, the final version of the game is full of bugs, and the content is not perfect, which makes the game not get a good reputation at the beginning of the sale. With the later updates and patches, the quality of the original plan of the game is brought back a little bit. Because of its unique design concept, this “god world” which pays homage to the old RPG has won many fans for the game. Although the reputation of the game is restored, the twists and turns are not over. The development contract signed by the publisher and Larian limits the amount of royalties they can get. Therefore, although the sales volume and reputation of the game are both good, Larian has not made much money, so they have no money.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Craig studio, the successor of CRPG who is more brave and fearless/c20689c7294f4f5fb58e3dc81e512a79.jpg" alt="Craig studio, the successor of CRPG who is more brave and fearless"><br>Although it’s 2D, the details are rich enough<br>It’s not easy to grow the well run in studio from 30 people back to three people, everything is back to the origin, they began to work in outsourcing for a living. After alleviating the economic situation, Larian released an independent documentary “beyond the divine kingdom” for “the divine kingdom”, which completed the content that could not be completed in the previous work, and also made a warm-up for their new work “the divine Kingdom 2: Dragon descendant”.<br>The development of divine world 2 borrowed the gamebryo engine used in ancient scroll 3 from Bethesda, and created a full 3D action role-playing game. Now, this work is still a very grand work, but who would have thought that history will be played again, and the game will be done without money. It would take another year for the game to be polished, but the money they have is not enough, so they have to put the finished but not optimized works on the market first to earn some of their capital.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Craig studio, the successor of CRPG who is more brave and fearless/efd84fe448204606be8980980a0223ed.jpg" alt="Craig studio, the successor of CRPG who is more brave and fearless"><br>This work and 2012 launched the developer’s clip edition, the single view picture is still excellent</p>
<p>#See the rainbow<br>After the recovery of funds, Larian began to plan to launch a real enhanced version of the game to make up for the deficiency of “divine world 2”. The enhanced version of “divine world 2: Legend of the Dragon Knights” was much better than before in terms of score and reputation, but because the game has missed the best time for sale, so there are not many people who pay attention to it The popularity of an IP is not as good as that of other big works, not to say that even if an enhanced version is produced, it will be robbed by others. For many years, high expenditure and low income have kept Larian on the verge of bankruptcy, which has repeatedly made them have the idea of independent operation.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Craig studio, the successor of CRPG who is more brave and fearless/59138b28e20c4db58c40165b57d891cb.jpg" alt="Craig studio, the successor of CRPG who is more brave and fearless"><br>Larian’s new work “God: original sin” was also put on the studio’s development agenda at this time. Because there was no publisher, they chose to raise funds in the way of crowdfunding on KickStarter, and at the same time, they adopted the development mode of early access (preemptive experience) on steam. Finally, with the help of many parties, the game was successfully launched. As always, there will be a lot of players who know how to appreciate the high quality. At that time, the summer specials of honest steam rushed to the top of the sales volume of the summer promotion in a flash. The hot sale of the game was that they paid off all their debts at once. At this time, they realized that their choice was right.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Craig studio, the successor of CRPG who is more brave and fearless/3a7c27df9f6a405b9a9662fe95a76288.jpg" alt="Craig studio, the successor of CRPG who is more brave and fearless"><br>Although the game is excellent in all aspects, it is not suitable for everyone<br>    concluding remarks<br>I believe that most players know how high the quality of “divine world: original sin 2” is. As an independent game, it almost won the best role-playing award in 2017, challenging the works of many front-line manufacturers. Today’s Laran finally can not live a daily life of fear, and can really be unrestrained to do the games they want to do.<br>Now they have won the development qualification of “gate 3 of Bode”. To be honest, the author has some psychological problems. After all, despite the fact that the “god world: original sin” and “gate of Bode” series are CRPG, they are two games with totally different styles.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Craig studio, the successor of CRPG who is more brave and fearless/39004197f3da4811b754e742fed2ceaa.jpg" alt="Craig studio, the successor of CRPG who is more brave and fearless"><br>The system setting of divine Kingdom: original sin is very close to the people, but even so, it is still a very small work. Many players can’t accept his playing method and rhythm, let alone his depth and difficulty are much higher than that of divine Kingdom: original sin. This is a big challenge for Larian, but the strength of Larian is undoubted. It’s not necessary for them to worry about the quality of the game if they give this IP, but whether they can balance the old and the new era is another problem. I hope Larian can keep CRPG as a game type and keep it from being buried in the historical torrent 。</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>Some time ago, the author came into contact with an independent game called donut count, in which players control a “black hole” and complete the puzzle of each level by “swallowing” the instruments in various scenes. The simple and lovely polygon painting style combines all kinds of interesting physical puzzles, and there is also a story full of comedy effect. The whole game experience is very relaxed and happy, which makes it hard to stop after getting started.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Doughnut city is a city where people travel for five years and marry for others/46d8474100ae4ed9960a63ea4226a828.jpg" alt="Doughnut city is a city where people travel for five years and marry for others"><br>However, when playing, this game always brings the author a sense of both seeing and seeing: I’ve seen this game before. Although it’s played differently, it’s true that there’s such a game, and it used to be very popular. At one time, I thought whether this independent game copied that game or not. After several queries and comparisons, the author found that there was indeed plagiarism, but the former plagiarized the latter.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Doughnut city is a city where people travel for five years and marry for others/0078313d53fc4314b36ce4dc5a1db16b.jpg" alt="Doughnut city is a city where people travel for five years and marry for others"><br>That’s right that’s it</p>
<h1 id="games-without-protagonists"><a href="#games-without-protagonists" class="headerlink" title="games without protagonists"></a>games without protagonists</h1><p>Donut County, translated as doughnut city in China, is a physics puzzle independent game created by Ben Esposito alone for five years. The original inspiration of the game came from a concept put forward on the Internet by Peter Molineux (nicknamed “magic bull”), a former lion studio game master, in 2012. He said:   “you can play a hole in the scene Move around so that specific elements fall into the hole “ “ at the right time. This concept inspired the same class as the game producer: why the protagonist in the game must be a role, not a concept? As magic bull said, it’s OK to let players play a hole in the game, and the hole is not a role, but a concept. With this in mind, Ben tried to make the game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Doughnut city is a city where people travel for five years and marry for others/bfe5a00dcd1f4346bc201ac43695d44f.jpg" alt="Doughnut city is a city where people travel for five years and marry for others"><br>Introduction to Ben Esposito’s homepage<br>During the development of the game, class also made a great reference to the PS2 game “Katamari Damacy” produced and released by Nanmeng palace in 2004. This is a leisure game. The playing rule is to control a villain to pick up objects scattered around the scene by rolling “blocks”. The “blocks” will stick these objects into a ball, and the goal of the game is to set a time limit Roll the “block” into the required size and launch it into the air. Although the overall style of the game is slightly curious, it is full of interest and is a kind of game work full of fun. Ban combined the concept of “black hole” of magic bull with “the soul”, thus derived   “black hole can make itself bigger by swallowing to swallow larger objects, but just blindly swallowing it is the same as the play method of” greedy for fish “, so why not add the puzzle element through the characteristics of black hole, after all, no one has said that black hole must exist like a bottomless hole”  “ Law.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Doughnut city is a city where people travel for five years and marry for others/c0f86fcc78064688a68b04498e8e8f2a.jpg" alt="Doughnut city is a city where people travel for five years and marry for others"><br>PSV version of “the soul” game screen</p>
<h1 id="take-the-lead"><a href="#take-the-lead" class="headerlink" title="take the lead"></a>take the lead</h1><p>Before becoming an independent game producer, ban worked as a checkpoint planner in the “giant sparrow” studio and participated in the development of the puzzle game “the unfinished swan”. His previous experience in making puzzle plays has been fully utilized in the development of new works. It only takes one year for the class to create the game. However, in the process of production, the class has more and more creative inspiration. He wants to add all these contents to the game, so the game is overthrown and redone again and again. Because of the lack of technical ability of himself, he has to learn and develop at the same time.<br>The game was put into production in 2013. Two years later, in 2015, he took the game to the independent game festival of that year and released the first publicity video. At that time, it seemed that the general playing method and system design of the work had been completed, and the rest was the polishing of plot and details.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Doughnut city is a city where people travel for five years and marry for others/c9bc7d70a9314232bb4442c846b7ae88.jpg" alt="Doughnut city is a city where people travel for five years and marry for others"><br>The first picture of a promotional film of doughnut City<br>When the first trailer was released, Ben didn’t say the exact release date of the game. After all, he didn’t know how many times he needed to overturn the game. How much effort has been paid for this game? Only the class knows it by itself. Watching the game get closer to completion, but what the class didn’t expect is that someone was ahead of him.<br>On May 25, 2018, the app store launched a leisure mobile game called “hole. IO”, which immediately topped the free game download list. This game has a well-known name in China called “black hole battle”, which is produced by voodoo, a well-known small game developer. The game of this hand game is to control a black hole. In a limited time, the player will devour anything you can see in the scene. The more you devour, the larger the volume will be. The game also supports multi player online, and even can devour a smaller black hole than you.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Doughnut city is a city where people travel for five years and marry for others/5c6dcbcccb6f422fa3c2e458f39867d5.jpg" alt="Doughnut city is a city where people travel for five years and marry for others"><br>Black hole battle app store page<br>For those who know more about the mobile game circle, voodoo, a French developer, has always been famous for copying other family games. Previously, Voodoo has copied several accused stories. For example, endless Golf copied Justin Smith’s desert gorf, Kelly snow copied Dave chener’s powder Alpine simulator, and Dai I also complained on twitter that “the game I released in 2015 was copied in 2017, and the funny thing is that people who play Shanzhai games still send emails to scold me for plagiarism”.<br>After all, it has been six years since the concept of “magic cow” was put forward. You said that no one would believe that it would take six years to develop a small leisure game with weak playing methods. And ban is a little famous in the game developer community. If other netizens didn’t trust him, he didn’t know his game had been used for reference.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Doughnut city is a city where people travel for five years and marry for others/5adc925feec84b5f82718161bb2f99d9.jpg" alt="Doughnut city is a city where people travel for five years and marry for others"><br>There are always one or two voodoo games you’ve played</p>
<p>#Quality is more than everything<br>Obviously, Voodoo imitated the concept and playing method of the game either from the promotional film or from the demo, but compared with the design idea of class’s doughnut City, it seems that voodoo just took away the core concept of the game, and did not take away the content that the class has not yet announced. As we all know, there is no copyright in the way of playing the game, and the class itself is very aggrieved about it, and he can’t help it. After that, ban posted such a tweet on his own Twitter:<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Doughnut city is a city where people travel for five years and marry for others/fc9455a2e8a94d91915600ec4a299a66.jpg" alt="Doughnut city is a city where people travel for five years and marry for others"><br>In other words, he didn’t expect that there would be a copycat version of his game that hasn’t been released yet, and he won the first place in several countries. He was very grateful for this. Fortunately, Voodoo didn’t launch the game when it was half developed, but chose to launch the game when it was about to be released. If it happened to catch up with him to overthrow and redo again, he would be mad. He also said that it’s good for everyone to know about the plagiarism of voodoo. He hoped that the peers would take confidentiality measures for their own games in the future and not spend too long on an original game like him. Doughnut City, developed by him, is a puzzle game with interesting plot. It’s totally different from black hole battle. There’s no need to fight for two games. I hope the players will like his game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Doughnut city is a city where people travel for five years and marry for others/19947e31bb7b4b18a318dba00bdbdce1.jpg" alt="Doughnut city is a city where people travel for five years and marry for others"><br>Official game screen<br>    concluding remarks<br>The sales volume of the game has not failed the efforts of the class for five years. The high quality of the game has won the praise of the players. After logging in to the app store, the game has been recommended by the home page of about 16 countries. The sales volume of the game once ranked in the top 10 of the 65 countries’ paid game rankings. After logging into steam platform later, it also got the game evaluation of “special praise”, and so far, 84% of the praise rate.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Doughnut city is a city where people travel for five years and marry for others/669326e86a154e5e92283079c2caca87.jpg" alt="Doughnut city is a city where people travel for five years and marry for others"><br>Doughnut city steam page<br>After the great success of the game, some media found a class and asked him about his mental journey over the past five years. To this end, he said, “I think I learned a lot in this way and learned more about how to play the game, but I also saw the dark side of the industry. Now I really realize how difficult it is to play the game and what kind of accident it will encounter, which also makes me understand Reality, in the past, I was overconfident, but I really did little. Now I have a deeper understanding of why high-quality games are expensive. “<br>After witnessing the success of doughnut City, it’s ironic to look back at the 4.6-point evaluation of “black hole battle” on the app store.</p>

    <title>Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/Do%20mow%20without%20knowing%20what%20to%20do,%20let%20glory%20lay%20down%20the%20unparalleled%20series%20of%20strategy%20games/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Nowadays, when it comes to the name “Koei (glory)”, many people may have their first reaction to the famous fighting game “death or life” series, especially to the beautiful girls. However, in any case, tecmo is mainly responsible for the development of the “dead or alive” series. Although tecmo has been merged with glory, it still makes its own games, just like the merged square Enix.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games/f233a80f87b84bc69cacb1173da1030e.jpg" alt="Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games"><br>Apart from the series of death or life, today’s glory also has a special interest in action games. In the past, glory was also a front-line historical theme game factory. In the early years, there were many excellent strategic works such as the wild hope of Xinchang and the age of great navigation. Although they still focus on historical games, they are not only the real Three Kingdoms It seems that there are not many works on other subjects, just like they are dedicated to the Three Kingdoms. However, it is not accurate to say that they are not so dedicated to the Three Kingdoms in the Three Kingdoms, but rather to the “matchless” in the Three Kingdoms.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games/86d42cb3e77c43738e089b95e069da14.jpg" alt="Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games"></p>
<p>#The three countries are unparalleled<br>Few people know that although the themes of the Three Kingdoms originated from the history of China, they are still popular in Japan, and no matter what era they are put in, people who like the three kingdoms are always concentrated in the youth groups. But those related to the three countries, whether books, films and even toys, have good sales volume, which can be said to be a very stable market in Japan. This situation is especially obvious in the early years. The first great work with the theme of the Three Kingdoms was the series of records of the Three Kingdoms launched by Guangrong in 1989. From 1993 to 1995, the series of records of the Three Kingdoms was made in the form of new year’s goods, with a very good sales volume. After that, there are many derivative works, such as the biography of the Three Kingdoms, the biography of Cao Cao, the biography of Zhuge Kongming, etc., but after all, they are all strategy games. Their operation and system make them only appear as a PC game after all. At that time, Japan is close to the host war before the millennium. The PC market can be said to be squeezed by the host and the host games without any survival space Meanwhile, Guangrong naturally knew the current situation, so he decided to slow down the development of “Three Kingdoms” series and try to enter the host market.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games/dcc9fd6e24f049758fb57a806a974a17.jpg" alt="Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games"><br>The peak work “records of the Three Kingdoms 5”<br>In that era, the most popular game in the field of mainframe is definitely action games. No matter 2D or 3D, as long as it’s good enough to play, many people will willingly pay for it. At the same time, fighting games were also very popular in the home computer market. After all, it was a bit troublesome to always run in the arcade in order to play a fighting game. There was a good heat in games such as “Boxer” and “Street Fighter”. Therefore, glory appointed the Omega force studio, which was specially set up to make a fighting game for the host computer game, to make a fighting game, but it should also be explained Shi Guangrong has always been a feature, so the first action game of Guangrong, “the three kingdoms are matchless” was logged into the PS platform in 1997. This is a change of the careful and rigorous style of history. Zhuge Liang, as well as mink Chan, sun Shangxiang and other women who have never been to the battlefield, have also taken up arms to fight against each other. Many players who like the themes of the Three Kingdoms can’t accept such a setting, so the quality of the game itself as a fighting game is acceptable, but the sales volume and reputation are not ideal , once let glory want to give up this IP.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games/4e0ef959d9744b108c71d0e40e697df8.jpg" alt="Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games"><br>1997 “the three kingdoms are unparalleled”</p>
<p>#The three kingdoms are unparalleled<br>Anyone who wants to play an excellent martial general in a Three Kingdoms action game wants to experience the pleasure of fighting bravely in the battlefield. The arcade game “devouring the world: Battle of the Red Cliff” produced by Capcom is the best proof. Many players appreciate this horizontal action game. Glory realized this only after investigating the market, so they decided not to give up “the three kingdoms are matchless” and changed its name to “true three kingdoms are matchless”. They changed the game from fighting to pure action, so that the players could experience the pleasure of playing a military general in a 3D scene. A year before the launch of true Three Kingdoms, Sony launched its next-generation console PS2. At the same time, Sony released the release notice of the game. Many fans of Three Kingdoms couldn’t care about the preciseness after seeing such a scene. 3D plus action, and the huge battlefield built by the soldiers everywhere, just think about it, it’s exciting, let alone true, and it’s all over 。 Because of this, the “true three unparalleled” to a certain extent also led to a wave of PS2 sales, many players are to play “true three unparalleled” (referred to as true three) just bought the machine.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games/f7a1903fc5454b0bbc790698834831b9.jpg" alt="Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games"><br>2000 true, the three kingdoms are unparalleled<br>Although zhensan is a pure single machine, its sales volume far exceeds the glorious expectation, even better than other games launched in the same period, and even the sales volume of Sanguozhi is not as good as it is. This makes glory ecstatic, and decides to attach importance to the “new IP” just launched. Only a year later, glory brought the sequel “true 32”, which coincided with the launch of Xbox by Microsoft at the same time. Therefore, the game also naturally launched the overseas version, which made the production achieve a sales volume of more than one million. Glory has been established for so many years, and never even a game can be as popular as “true three 2”. It’s estimated that glory’s mouth can’t close its smile. They decided to strike while the iron is hot and launch more works as soon as possible. Just like many Japanese games at that time had the habit of launching enhanced version, the company proudly launched the second generation of enhanced version of the work “true three 2: biography of the great general”, adding several new generals, scenes and plots, and still sold more than a million sales, while the glory of winning many times also tasted the sweetness, and decided to suspend the development of strategy games at hand and concentrate on the production of “true three”, er No, it’s the matchless series.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games/f257484583e44f8ca35b7f1591f27c6a.jpg" alt="Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games"><br>2002 “true, the three kingdoms are unparalleled: biography of the great general”</p>
<p>#Three Kingdoms vs Warring States<br>Through the glorious study of the history of the Three Kingdoms and the Warring States period, it was also a change of taste for the players. Later, by launching the work “unparalleled in the Warring States period”, the protagonist was replaced by a famous legendary role in the history of Japan. On the other hand, it met the needs of the people of our country, and the sales volume was relatively good. At the same time, the development of “Zhen San 3” has become the enlightenment work of the vast majority of Chinese players due to the introduction of PC version. This work has greatly improved the playability of the game, not only the weapons have been added to the upgrade system to open up higher challenges for the players, but also the custom generals can be made to fight in the battlefield to enhance the sense of substitution of the game. Various advantages have been widely spread by the players, making this work an indelible classic in the minds of many players. From the beginning of this work, glory not only launched an enhanced version of the game, but also tried to add the political system in the chronicles of the Three Kingdoms. As a result, a different work named “true three: Empire” was born, which allows players to play the king of a country and try to unify the world, rather than simply follow the plot of each force.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games/4496750e1af2404082632ccd548bde44.jpg" alt="Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games"><br>2003 “true, Three Kingdoms unparalleled 3”<br>At this point, almost every generation of works will have the tradition of launching “biography of the general” and “empire”. Even in these derivative versions, derivative versions will be developed again. A generation of works will be sold without knowing how many copies. It will be a bit ugly for the players to have a glorious meal. The Three Kingdoms and the Warring States will inevitably make the players feel aesthetic fatigue. It’s better to mix the two characters together for a big fight, and then make an independent plot for them, which saves time, labor and money. Isn’t it beautiful? Under this assumption, the product is the series of “unparalleled serpent”, which gathers the roles of the Three Kingdoms and the Warring States, joins several new original roles by the way, and lets the heroes of different time and space travel back and forth to fight against the powerful enemies. It is the appearance of this seemingly magical work that officially declares the glory in the field of action games from now on It doesn’t matter to restore history.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games/5780e2a903ac48a1a51b4af019f35d4d.jpg" alt="Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games"><br>2007 the great snake<br>But even if all these characters are assembled, some players will still feel dissatisfied. Even though the series of “double snake” is much better than the other two double works in all aspects, it is always changing soup and medicine. Glory naturally wants to get rid of this dilemma, but how can I make a lifetime of historical games? I really don’t know about other subjects and fields, and I don’t have many famous IPS at hand, so I can’t take out those boaters in the era of great navigation and make them unique? That’s obviously not realistic. And just as glorious as he was scratching his head, Wandai, the infamous “B Consortium” holding numerous well-known IPS, found a door.</p>
<h1 id="unique"><a href="#unique" class="headerlink" title="unique"></a>unique</h1><p>To say which IP is the most expensive in Wanda’s hands, it’s probably a few well-known “gota” series. This time, Wanda found the door of glory, which is exactly the foundation of ω - force’s production of “matchless” series for many years. After all, a game can be sold in several generations and can be bought well. There are not many games in the whole industry. Wanda wants to let glory take his place We make a unique game with the theme of “Gotha”. In any case, Gotha is more popular than that of the Three Kingdoms in Japan. If we launch a series of “Gotha unique” works along the way of “Three Kingdoms unique”, we will surely be able to sell them. The motivation of the ten thousand generations is no doubt equal to sending coals in the snow for glory. The two sides can say that they are on the spot, and then put this unparalleled game as high as IP on the development agenda.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games/1204f11f8b314a4ca54dbc598581b7b1.jpg" alt="Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games"><br>2007 “Kota unrivalled”<br>In 2007, the new series of masterpieces “Gotha matchless” officially went on the market. With the support of the copyright of tens of thousands of generations, glory can’t change it at will, but it still follows the tradition. The story mode is based on the plot of multiple animations, and the overall playing method is much more refreshing than the series of “Three Kingdoms matchless”. After all, the characters have changed from generals to mecha, with strong mobility and various kinds Qingping big kill tool is available, which can almost be understood as the high-tech enhanced version of “Three Kingdoms are unparalleled”. But even if there is no such picture of zagu with thousands of enemies in any of the Gotha series of works, though it is a hot-blooded animation, its core idea is anti war after all. In the eyes of many loyal fans of Gotha, it is very different from the original, so it can not accept such settings in the game. At the same time, due to the relationship of copyright fee, the price of the game is much higher than that of the Three Kingdoms series. Therefore, the sales volume of the game has not been equal to that of the Three Kingdoms series.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games/ec589973ab1043a5885d235a134b7ffd.jpg" alt="Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games"><br>2013 “true Godard”</p>
<h1 id="dying"><a href="#dying" class="headerlink" title="dying"></a>dying</h1><p>There are five works launched in the series, from generation 1 to generation 3, as well as the special edition of generation 1 and “true Gotha” which have not achieved the sales volume of million level. This achievement may be considered as just passing in the eyes of generation 10. After all, the big money they earn is not in the game, but it is not ideal for glory. It seems that the reason is not that it’s a high-end theme, but that “matchless” itself has been playing for too many years. In the next era, the mainframe has begun to appear fatigue. After all, no matter how to change the theme and IP, matchless is always that matchless, unable and always the same. Just like the classical FPs in the early years, it can shoot all enemies on the screen with its own power Generally, it’s cool to play once in a while, and will be eliminated gradually with the passage of time. In the gap between the distribution and after-sales of each generation of “as high as matchless”, ω - force will still launch the “true three” series from time to time, but since the third generation, the series has been on the decline, even to the fifth generation with the best look of human design, its sales volume has fallen below one million.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games/8716c15c407f4bf9aa74dfca0cd032e8.jpg" alt="Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games"><br>2005 “the three kingdoms are unique 4”<br>Starting from the works of three generations later, ω - force will make some adjustments and improvements to some places of the new work of “true three”, such as modifying the game mechanism or combat system, while the five generations can be said to be a watershed, not only the difficulty is greatly improved, the combat system is slightly abandoned, but also the planning changes are too many to be completed when the game is released. It is worth mentioning that this has nothing to do with the development team, But glory is too eager for success. Seeing that the company’s income is not as good as it is day by day, we are not calm down to find the cause of the problem. Instead, we choose to follow the online wind to turn our IP online games, such as the chronicles of the Three Kingdoms ol, the age of navigation ol, and of course, we can’t get rid of the real Three Kingdoms unparalleled ol. These games are basically ghost clothes except for the stop clothes. It’s not a long time since the company’s economy has not returned to a positive number for a long time, and even the merger with tecmo has not been able to recover in a particularly intuitive way.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games/df6a66a1b79e4110a84e4c52c1a01f97.jpg" alt="Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games"><br>It is worth mentioning that the national service of “the true Three Kingdoms unique ol” is still in operation</p>
<p>#Everything can be unique<br>In 2011, after a period of brewing, Wushuang decided to break out. All works of the whole Wushuang series launched new works together. Although it is impossible to reproduce the past scenery, at least it can earn some money. Seeing the former partner’s madness, Wan Dai once again found glory and decided to give him a few more IPS to do, including one of the three giants of long comics, “the pirate king”, with the blessing of such divine IP, the adaptation work “the pirate is matchless” has been missing for a long time, making the matchless series rush to the position of million level sales again, and even once broke through the highest authorized adaptation of matchless series Sales volume. Another version of “Beidou matchless” adapted from the classic comic “Beidou Shenquan” has achieved the expected sales volume because it’s an old comic. This glory is disillusionment. What’s the taste of having a strong thigh hug, so I began to visit other manufacturers, trying to get several significant IPS from them to make matchless series.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games/2990aecebb7e499ab44a7485694bef10.jpg" alt="Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games"><br>2012 unique Pirates<br>Glory visited Se and Nintendo successively, obtained the IP authorization of the brave fight against the dragon and legend of Zelda series from them, and successively launched the brave fight against the Dragon: Heroes and unique Zelda. These works can be said to combine the characteristics of the original works and strengthen the original “mowing” method, so as to make the fight more interesting without losing the original There is a style of work. After that, Guangrong produced the works of “the legend of sword wind” and “the war history of Aslan”, and Guangrong himself was not idle. Referring to the ancient Roman history, he produced “the incomparable of Troy”. It seems that as long as there has been a battlefield or based on the recent battle, all works can be made into incomparable. Glory seems to have been enlightened at one time. Although these are unparalleled, they all have distinctive playing methods. It seems to him that only by referring to other people’s works can we make good things. “Reference setting” seems to have become glorious expertise.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games/e527f2882d684557a70400ee9058a1c4.jpg" alt="Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games"><br>2014 Zelda unrivalled</p>
<h1 id="end-revolution-is-not-over"><a href="#end-revolution-is-not-over" class="headerlink" title="end: revolution is not over"></a>end: revolution is not over</h1><p>Take someone else’s IP to do a lifetime of unparalleled, so glory have you ever thought of the original works? The answer is yes. In 2017, Guangrong produced an all-star fight work that gathered up as many as 13 works of his own, and the name is “no double all stars”. Of course, it is not realistic to put all the characters in 13 games into one game, so each work only takes a few representative characters. This work, like the previous authorized works, has even gone beyond the limit. It refers to the fans’ tendency of game design. However, due to the drastic reform of the combat system, many old fans of unparalleled series are dissatisfied. However, they still choose to buy for the sake of many characters participating in the war, so the sales volume and public praise are very common. After years of work with different themes, Guangrong also has some ideas about his “old guys”. In order not to make the work repeat the same mistakes, they decided to change the new work of “true three”. But what’s most surprising is that they actually made “true three eight” into a seamless and open world.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games/86d83b6c98274db499c9f0f8086817ca.jpg" alt="Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games"><br>2017 no double all stars<br>I don’t have any opinions on the setting of open world for action games, but it’s only limited to linear process games. However, the “true three” series has always achieved fast-paced and intensive battles on a single battlefield scale. Changing to a seamless open world means that each battle will have a long running process like the task in GTA, which will cut off the game experience Split sense, obviously not suitable for the “true three” series, as if the “dragon like” into the turn system general violation. Sure enough, the game has made unprecedented bad reviews after its release, and even once became one of the few “bad reviews like a tide” works on the steam platform. Think about it carefully, this is not only the first time that “true three” uses the seamless open world setting, but also the glorious first time since ancient times to make the seamless open world game. There will inevitably be immature places, but this time The second is that they think everything is too good.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games/dbc3d5e2a06d4c8d8a0e62a32997ceef.jpg" alt="Do mow without knowing what to do, let glory lay down the unparalleled series of strategy games"><br>2018 “true, three unparalleled 8”<br>The failure of “true three 8” undoubtedly hurt the glory and vitality. Fortunately, it was not long before “matchless snake 3” came out to remedy the situation, relying on the relatively good quality of the game, or the signboard “true Three Kingdoms matchless” will probably be so depressed in the future. It’s almost 20 years since the emergence of the first unparalleled mowing works. In the past 20 years, the “unparalleled” series has been brilliant and declined. It’s undeniable that no matter how innovative the series is, it’s still a little weak. Even those “ancient FPS” knew to slow down and make a reasonable innovation before continuing, rather than just making a little modification Put it on the shelf like this. How to rejuvenate the matchless series is glorious. It seems that it will be some time before the next meeting of the new series of “true three”. After all, glory is the new series of “Three Kingdoms” which hasn’t been moved for many years. Look forward to the future performance of this legendary series. What players want to see is definitely not “5S of Goddess strange news”.</p>

    <title>EA returns to steam after eight years, and orange is really going to rot this time</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/EA%20returns%20to%20steam%20after%20eight%20years,%20and%20orange%20is%20really%20going%20to%20rot%20this%20time/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>On October 26 this year, EA, a US first-line game developer and publisher, released a small video on the official twitter. In the video, a cup printed with the logo of ealogo appeared, and the cup was slowly steaming with no words. Many netizens began to speculate that EA was hinting to the outside world that it was about to return to valve’s steam platform, and in the test version of steam, they could see several EA games exclusive to original platform of EA.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/EA returns to steam after eight years, and orange is really going to rot this time/fe3b4393a8f5404985f7f0a709ac5a83.jpg" alt="EA returns to steam after eight years, and orange is really going to rot this time"><br>On October 29, EA officially announced to cooperate with steam again, and is ready to bring its own game subscription service EA access and several masterpieces back to steam platform, such as battlefield 5 and apex hero, which will be officially launched before 2020. As soon as this news came out, a group of melon eating players were both excited and couldn’t help laughing. On the one hand, they were able to get rid of origin’s bad experience. On the other hand, it reminded the players of the scene that EA decided to leave steam eight years ago.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/EA returns to steam after eight years, and orange is really going to rot this time/d52065482066443d87626ce230d1f255.jpg" alt="EA returns to steam after eight years, and orange is really going to rot this time"><br>    protest<br>In 2011, EA’s most popular game was battlefield 3, which used a new engine to create a sub era level picture and a shocking modern battlefield atmosphere. Many players were looking forward to battlefield: Rebel company 2 as an excellent performance of practical nature. Many players also thought that this generation’s works should not be too big Problem. While players are holding their fingers and waiting for battlefield 3 to be released, EA announced that the work will not log on steam platform, but on origin platform which is about to be launched.<br>Players have said that EA’s wings are hard and they want to fly. Some people are not optimistic about this new platform. After all, this platform only has EA’s own game, while others say it doesn’t matter. As long as they can play on a PC, it doesn’t matter which platform they log on to. However, no matter what choice they make, the players begin to speculate about the reason why EA chose to leave steam. Some people say it’s because of sharing, some people say it’s just that EA has expanded. When another EA game, Longteng century 2, came off the shelves, EA finally explained this.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/EA returns to steam after eight years, and orange is really going to rot this time/8c1327bc1c14405b9243e99d3c233cb7.jpg" alt="EA returns to steam after eight years, and orange is really going to rot this time"><br>Battlefield 3<br>In fact, EA didn’t leave steam for any so-called sharing reason. When EA and steam negotiated battlefield 3 to log in to steam platform, V club said that it would limit the ability of developers to provide direct technical support for players. Simply speaking, developers are not allowed to use their own clients in their own service-oriented games, update and upgrade all contents and patches And DLC need to be released through steam. If you have played the online service-oriented games such as warframe and thunder of war on steam, you can understand better. After steam starts the game, it starts the game client, through which players can get news, activity and other information as well as push the updated content. Steam is not allowed to appear at that time This kind of client has never had this policy in any game platform before, which makes EA feel strongly dissatisfied. In a fit of rage, EA decides to take off several big works of its own, and no new game will be handed over to steam agent while establishing its own portal.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/EA returns to steam after eight years, and orange is really going to rot this time/6be85994b32f458385cc734d6bcce503.jpg" alt="EA returns to steam after eight years, and orange is really going to rot this time"><br>The second century of dragon</p>
<p>In the early years, EA has occupied half of the country in the three fields of “gun car ball”. There are world-class well-known IP towns such as FIFA, top flying car and battlefield. These works have a large and stable player group, so even if you choose to fly alone, you can have a good time. The original origin was a menacing one. The number of users in the world almost matched the steam platform with 50 million players. Apart from the complete monopoly of their own games, as a game platform, it will naturally act as an agent for other manufacturers’ games. EA’s move is undoubtedly to separate some users of steam, and in the face of this situation, community V is helpless.<br>Origin platform is nicknamed “rotten orange” by players in China, largely because the platform experience is too messy. The update and download of the game and even the landing can be too slow without accelerator, which makes players doubt whether there is a problem with their own network, but it is undeniable that this does not affect origin in the global market At the beginning of this year, it attracted more than 50 million players with an “apex hero”, which is still rising.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/EA returns to steam after eight years, and orange is really going to rot this time/3659453d08254dce9d545d25ed16db3a.jpg" alt="EA returns to steam after eight years, and orange is really going to rot this time"><br>Heroes of apex<br>However, in recent years, it seems that the news about EA is mostly negative, mainly around the design and quality issues in some games, such as the “pay 2 win” of the original Star Wars: Frontline 2, the low completion of the first launch of “battlefield 5” and “hymn” and the low handling of external hook, which directly affect the origin platform core The activeness of the heart players not only makes the evaluation of the game plummet, but also the platform gets involved together. In addition, the use experience of the platform is not increased, which leads to the infinite amplification of the negative image of EA.<br>The closest game manufacturer to origin is Ubisoft, France. Many of its games are sold on the origin platform. There is no doubt that the two sides support each other. But the EA’s return to steam may be a big problem for Ubisoft. In recent years, the division of Ubisoft’s game platform has always been a matter of steam’s opposition. Since the end of March this year, its works have basically stopped landing on the steam platform, and instead joined the epic platform next door, which is tit for tat with steam. Compared with EA, it’s a walk away and a return. The positions of both sides may fall into an awkward situation.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/EA returns to steam after eight years, and orange is really going to rot this time/2c78f386a0a749dea249219b9d2d8008.jpg" alt="EA returns to steam after eight years, and orange is really going to rot this time"><br>Hymn<br>According to EA, the New Star Wars Jedi: the fallen samurai, which is about to be released, can now be pre purchased on the steam platform as the first game to be returned to steam, and the most popular EA access game subscription service will be returned together with the game. Only this member subscription service under EA is highly praised and can be enjoyed at will for only $5 per month Thanks to the many products released by EA, the price of this subscription service is the cheapest among all the existing subscription services. After all, this subscription service is only for their own games, but the series like battlefield and FIFA are also very attractive, and steam has become the fourth platform with EA subscription service.<br>As for the online problem of platform after logging in steam, EA indicates that steam account can be bound with origin platform. In the initial stage of game setting, the origin platform initiator needs to be installed, and after setting, the game can be started directly from steam. Players between the two platforms can communicate with each other, so the server should be provided by EA. Players who wish to join steam’s VAC system can get rid of this idea.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/EA returns to steam after eight years, and orange is really going to rot this time/9d7672a2756e48b587f41790d1a093c3.jpg" alt="EA returns to steam after eight years, and orange is really going to rot this time"><br>Star Wars Jedi: the fallen order<br>    concluding remarks<br>For players, EA’s return to steam is undoubtedly a good thing to celebrate. After all, they can purchase games and online in a more convenient way in the future, without worrying about origin’s messy network experience. However, there are advantages and disadvantages. Landing in steam will undoubtedly further expand the player base of its games, and the increase of player base must be the decline of the environmental quality of the game, whether it is overcrowding or external problems may occur more frequently. However, in any case, looking forward to EA’s return to steam’s performance, G Pang seems to be trying to attract more big game companies such as Bethesda and Microsoft. Maybe this is the V club’s counterattack against epic.</p>

    <title>Eight years of three game gorgeous transformation, why is there still someone blowing Wizard series</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/Eight%20years%20of%20three%20game%20gorgeous%20transformation,%20why%20is%20there%20still%20someone%20blowing%20Wizard%20series/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>If we talk about RPG Games in the early years, we believe that many people’s first impressions will come up with famous game works such as ancient scrolls, Bode’s gate, etc. players who like Japanese RPG should think of “the brave fight against the dragon” or “Final Fantasy”, and those who are interested in martial arts themes may think of “immortal sword”, “Xuanyuan sword”, etc Domestic RPG. This is not a different thing, after all, in the early years RPG Games although there are many masterpieces, but back and forth on so many game companies are doing, for this small market can be said to be in a monopoly state.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Eight years of three game gorgeous transformation, why is there still someone blowing Wizard series/c5ccdca56c2341fda0468eaaaf47b0fc.jpg" alt="Eight years of three game gorgeous transformation, why is there still someone blowing Wizard series"><br>If you talk about RPG Games, you may have to give up an extra position in the above list, which belongs to the wizard series from Poland. When talking about the name “Wizard”, many players may reach a consensus in their hearts, such as “conscience of Polish donkey industry”, “Wizard 3” is the best in the world “and other praise words. When a new open world game appears, someone will compare” Wizard “with it, and almost all the people who have played it will say well. As for where to say it again Not last so, maybe you can only feel it after playing.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Eight years of three game gorgeous transformation, why is there still someone blowing Wizard series/8b6b75c36a0c4988a4a9ce032712f6fd.jpg" alt="Eight years of three game gorgeous transformation, why is there still someone blowing Wizard series"></p>
<h1 id="“demon-hunter”"><a href="#“demon-hunter”" class="headerlink" title="“demon hunter”"></a>“demon hunter”</h1><p>The first generation of “Wizard” game works was born in 2007. The game is adapted from the local novel of the same name in Poland, “the witch”. Although this novel has a small position in the local literature field and won many awards, its popularity is not very high. It seems that some people in the game company CD project (CDP) like this work very much, which is detailed in the game The setting of world outlook and the unique magic theme of the middle ages were fascinated, so they decided to set up a development team to develop an RPG game based on this novel. Early CDP mainly made a living by acting as game software in the local area, but what they did was not only to import the game from overseas and sell it directly in a new package, but also to provide detailed localization work for the game, packaging the game into a new version from the inside out, and making some excellent gifts for the entity game through independent consultation, so as to make every game Box games are worth more.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Eight years of three game gorgeous transformation, why is there still someone blowing Wizard series/46f0bcc7e5974b66b947e936866b34ae.jpg" alt="Eight years of three game gorgeous transformation, why is there still someone blowing Wizard series"><br>The gate of Bode<br>As for why they did this, it was largely because the development of the Polish electronic game industry at that time was not very good. They just wanted to impress the players with sincerity, so as to attract more people and build a good reputation for themselves, so as to achieve sustainable development. The most famous and popular game they represented in the early stage of entrepreneurship was the door of Bode produced by BioWare. Therefore, the company’s cognitive concept of RPG was greatly influenced by this game. After obtaining the authorization of “demon hunter”, the development of the game is in the charge of its CD project red. At first, the play method of the game is similar to that of “gate of Bode”, and it is also operated by clicking. For a 3D large-scale RPG game, this play method is somewhat inconsistent. Many game publishers do not approve the game, so cdpr decided to Overthrow and redo the whole game, and consult with our best partner and idol, BioWare.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Eight years of three game gorgeous transformation, why is there still someone blowing Wizard series/35e9a85c6605411a8bcf8ea02543e4cb.jpg" alt="Eight years of three game gorgeous transformation, why is there still someone blowing Wizard series"><br>CD Project Red</p>
<h1 id="craftsman-spirit"><a href="#craftsman-spirit" class="headerlink" title="craftsman spirit"></a>craftsman spirit</h1><p>In the early generation of wizard, BioWare was used to develop the aurora engine of night without winter. BioWare also provided guidance and technical support for cdpr in the old friendship, so we can see the current series of wizard. In essence, the wizard series and the 3D dragon and dungeon series of the same period play the same way. They just talk to NPC everywhere to do tasks, kill monsters everywhere to upgrade, but they firmly catch the players’ eyes with the huge volume and full name of the play, and create a very wonderful plot with the support of the original novel, To this day, many fans of the series still think that the plot of the first generation works is the best. Huge text volume and real-time calculus performance, rich game content, huge and beautiful open world, all of the original RPG games he had, all of them did not have, but the reputation is too small, so this work is not as well-known as the original novel, but the word-of-mouth of the game is really excellent.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Eight years of three game gorgeous transformation, why is there still someone blowing Wizard series/a00d4b6317c04fff96b585c934c5c45b.jpg" alt="Eight years of three game gorgeous transformation, why is there still someone blowing Wizard series"><br>Wizard<br>By the time of the Second Generation Wizard 2: King assassin, it was only four years before the game was released, and the game had been strengthened in all aspects. For players who have played wizard 3, if you go back to Wizard 2, you may feel that the main character of the game, jarot, doesn’t like the shape very much, but in terms of the screen performance, even if it’s put on now, it’s not bad, or even better.<br>This time, cdpr independently built the red engine by its own strength. The development of the engine and the development of the game are almost synchronous. However, due to the lack of experience, the optimization of the first version of the game and the bug problem are mostly, but the normal play of the game is basically not affected. The game uses non-linear narrative, and there are many sensitive elements to avoid. Even a small game has to create a decent, all of which is to make the story of the game more real. Regardless of the setting of the background, no one can easily understand and indulge in the story, and there will be no distant alienation in other overhead settings Sense, in wizard, there are not too many ritualistic passages, nor deliberately modified lines and dialogues. It’s like telling a story in vernacular, but the story is still too wonderful.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Eight years of three game gorgeous transformation, why is there still someone blowing Wizard series/87e0b8565fbd4ee7b5ac77799b64b3eb.jpg" alt="Eight years of three game gorgeous transformation, why is there still someone blowing Wizard series"><br>Wizard 2: King Assassin<br>The three generation work “Wizard 3: Wild hunting” further draws on the failure experience in the previous work, and adds more reasonable and rich content while modifying and strengthening, such as strengthening the detailed performance of the game, introducing an original small game. Although the physical effect of the game and the interaction between the role and the scene are not very good, it is nothing for “Wizard” A small problem that hurt Daya. The reputation of wizard 3 is so good that I don’t need too much explanation. But let’s put aside the phenomenon and see the essence. Wizard 3 is also an open world game. Opening the map also has dense icons and task points. As a work of story before continuation, the previous stories need to be understood by checking the brief introduction, which is very exciting by reason Headache design will even directly affect the overall experience of the game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Eight years of three game gorgeous transformation, why is there still someone blowing Wizard series/900d427d353743a8bfdb44356ff7273a.jpg" alt="Eight years of three game gorgeous transformation, why is there still someone blowing Wizard series"><br>Wizard 3: Wild hunting<br>Of course, cdpr can’t fail to notice this, so most of the interactive content scattered on the map in the game basically doesn’t repeat, and the repeatable tasks are uniformly placed on the bulletin board for the players to pick up by themselves; in order to avoid the players’ confusion when facing a “familiar stranger”, different dialogue options can be used for the shortest and fastest way The way to understand the story background, and these options are the choice of the player to see or not to see. In short, in addition to the game’s bugs and optimizations and other force majeure, the game itself provides a solution to every problem that the player may encounter in the game, such as the multi field archive that can be saved at any time, the skill tree that can be added points first and then matched, and the dialogue and transition that can be fast forward and skipped. These subtle designs can provide a very comfortable game experience for the player Except for the unsatisfactory combat system, the whole experience of the game really can’t find any fault.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Eight years of three game gorgeous transformation, why is there still someone blowing Wizard series/8713e161282748b487e97fd61fb49269.jpg" alt="Eight years of three game gorgeous transformation, why is there still someone blowing Wizard series"><br>The game world is more real and natural than before<br>    concluding remarks<br>To sum up, the game has repeatedly polished craftsmanship, continuous improvement of self-improvement, wonderful stories that are close to the people and meet the public taste, and good game experience, all of which make the game obtain a high evaluation. As for whether the game map of the game is open enough to see, it is a secondary bonus item, no matter whether it is not affected, but better. They have not forgotten what is the core of an RPG, nor their company’s core spirit since their start-up, that is, player first. The wizard series has opened the door of the international game market with a sincere attitude and promoted the whole Polish game development industry. The state holds its works as “national treasure”, and it is not unreasonable to regard the company as a state-owned enterprise.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Eight years of three game gorgeous transformation, why is there still someone blowing Wizard series/993c4744e8524c098ef54e929d0ff54c.jpg" alt="Eight years of three game gorgeous transformation, why is there still someone blowing Wizard series"><br>The sequel is regarded as “blood and wine” sold by DLC<br>Of course, many people like this game, maybe because of the personality charm of jerotte. Maybe we players need to know more about his story than himself. His story is complete and full, and has a fairly good ending, which makes him deeply impressed in the mind of the players. Just like other games that have become the protagonist, we don’t play him, It’s more like witnessing his every experience and growth from a friend’s perspective, so we can have this unspeakable feeling with the players. As a video game, the wizard series may have its greatness reflected in this, such a game deserves to be blown out, and we also hope that the cyberpunk 2077 will not forget its original intention and go to a higher level in the near future.</p>

    <title>Experience a lonely fantasy adventure, the pioneer of mystery game mysterious island</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/Experience%20a%20lonely%20fantasy%20adventure,%20the%20pioneer%20of%20mystery%20game%20mysterious%20island/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In the nineties of the last century, Action Adventure PC games were all the rage. In Japan, they usually used visual novels with pictures and words and dubbing. In Europe and America, they used to manipulate a character to look for clues around a scene to complete puzzles and promote the game process. In such a big environment, Lucas arts and cyan Inc are the two representatives. The former is famous for “clever exploration and clearance” and “Monkey Island little hero”, while the latter becomes a legend relying on a first person mystery play called “Myst”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Experience a lonely fantasy adventure, the pioneer of mystery game mysterious island/cc1a3e6f1777415492e8d2775439e6e9.jpg" alt="Experience a lonely fantasy adventure, the pioneer of mystery game mysterious island"><br>Monkey island hero 2 Special Edition<br>For the European and American players in the 1980s and 1990s, “Myst” is a household name. In China, when some players still remember that they have heard the name, the game is as mysterious as his name. But this does not prevent it from being a super quality puzzle game. What it carries is not only the peak of adventure games, but also the pioneer of the concept of “first person puzzle”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Experience a lonely fantasy adventure, the pioneer of mystery game mysterious island/0f93c70f4ecf494abff59bec1a6fd96f.jpg" alt="Experience a lonely fantasy adventure, the pioneer of mystery game mysterious island"></p>
<h1 id="beyond-the-classic-of-Diablo"><a href="#beyond-the-classic-of-Diablo" class="headerlink" title="beyond the classic of Diablo"></a>beyond the classic of Diablo</h1><p>The mysterious Island series has a history of 26 years. It has launched six works and a derivative MMO online game. It is worth mentioning that the fourth generation of the game, mysterious Island 4: Apocalypse, is developed by Yubi bimontllier studio, while the fifth generation, mysterious island 5: the end of the times, is distributed by Ubisoft. This is called cyan The studio also has a lot to do with Ubisoft.<br>As the author said above, this is the first puzzle game in the history. If you have played the witness by Jonathan Bullough, the God of independent games, you can probably understand what kind of experience it is, but you have replaced the traditional FPS operation with mouse click. For the players who had heard about this game in those years, the most impressive thing is not how fun this game is, but the horrible sales volume of this game:   cyan has achieved sales volume of tens of millions with only two works, almost surpassing the classic RPG series of the same period  .<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Experience a lonely fantasy adventure, the pioneer of mystery game mysterious island/77829cf52b3c426599fdb952cfa02a0e.jpg" alt="Experience a lonely fantasy adventure, the pioneer of mystery game mysterious island"><br>1993 Mysterious Island<br>In more popular terms, this is a “  who am I? Where am i? What should I do   in the game, no matter the destination or the plot, or even the puzzles, makes people confused. The protagonist in the game is thrown into a world that looks very strange, and tries to explore in this strange world, to find out the hidden secrets that are not known by others. Many puzzles in the game are often designed in a wild way , players need to fly to open their own brain holes to crack. It is undeniable that many of the design inspiration of the witness comes from this work. It is also a person who explores in a huge open world, which is the core of the mysterious Island series:   experience a lonely fantasy adventure  . The plot of the game is quite obscure. Players need to collect notes and manuscripts in the game and combine them to get the story about the world, which is also the potential main goal of the game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Experience a lonely fantasy adventure, the pioneer of mystery game mysterious island/7e5a6820f7a1417691881aa0bdd7ffaa.jpg" alt="Experience a lonely fantasy adventure, the pioneer of mystery game mysterious island"></p>
<h1 id="handwritten-fantasy-world"><a href="#handwritten-fantasy-world" class="headerlink" title="handwritten fantasy world"></a>handwritten fantasy world</h1><p>Entering the game, a scene that can be explored interactively and a mouse pointer constitute the whole content of the game. There is no hint, no guidance, no tutorial, or even the most basic item column of the general puzzle solving game. The advantage of doing this is that the overall view of the game screen is very clear and simple, but the disadvantage is also very obvious, that is, most of the time, the players do not at all Know how to play this game, even sometimes it can’t be cracked when you watch the strategy. It’s called “hard core” to say it’s nice, and “inhuman” to say it’s ugly.<br>The whole game is full of strong philosophical atmosphere. Most of the time, even if the players can read and understand what is written on those notes, they often do not understand it. Therefore, many players often go to try with curiosity, and quit after the experience. Can such a game be played? Nothing has been said. The design of puzzles is still so “hard core”. Many times, you can’t think with common sense. If you really choose to study and ponder slowly, you will get a very enjoyable adventure experience.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Experience a lonely fantasy adventure, the pioneer of mystery game mysterious island/752e5c01377a4c218fb7215d5d59a529.jpg" alt="Experience a lonely fantasy adventure, the pioneer of mystery game mysterious island"><br>The story of the game tells that there was a race named d’ni on the earth many years ago. They were also human, but they lived a long life, and they lived in the underground world because they hated the light very much. In addition to longevity, this mysterious race has a magic power. They make a kind of strange paper and pen with unknown technology, and can write a kind of book called “the book of transmission” with these paper and pens. The book describes all kinds of strange overhead world. Different books also have different worlds. Take these books to find another one called “the book of connection” Through the book of connection, we can enter into the world of books we carry. Because these worlds are created based on books, the denizens can easily modify the books to change the world in the books, and the players will appear in such a world to explore the story of this mysterious world.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Experience a lonely fantasy adventure, the pioneer of mystery game mysterious island/46fe9d3e202347299f9a258b8b355d66.jpg" alt="Experience a lonely fantasy adventure, the pioneer of mystery game mysterious island"></p>
<h1 id="“it-kills-the-adventure-game”"><a href="#“it-kills-the-adventure-game”" class="headerlink" title="“it kills the adventure game”"></a>“it kills the adventure game”</h1><p>In addition to exploring and solving puzzles, there are no other elements in the game, so the overall style of the game is relatively gentle. Because there is no UI design, most of the scenes are like the demo used to show technology in earlier years, which is very visual impact, so this series can be understood as “walking simulator with solving puzzles”. The game has a rather beautiful game picture and soundtrack, and the comfortable rhythm also enables people to focus on the puzzle itself. In fact, the puzzle in the game is not related to the main line of the story, but because its design style and the overall atmosphere of the game create a high sense of fit, so that the players will not have a sense of play. This very intoxicating addictive experience makes the first generation of games attract countless fans once they are on the market, which has won the high praise of the players and the media.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Experience a lonely fantasy adventure, the pioneer of mystery game mysterious island/5febef691d55428f99045477e41f2d82.jpg" alt="Experience a lonely fantasy adventure, the pioneer of mystery game mysterious island"><br>As mentioned at the beginning of the article, in addition to cyan studio, Lucas art is the most representative manufacturer of adventure puzzle games. The game works of the two sides have their own merits, one is the main humorous, and the other is the main comfortable philosophical experience. Taking this as an opportunity, the adventure game began to split, and many subsequent works on the market began to refer to the style of cyan’s mysterious island, so there were contradictions and differences between the two sides. Although the game experience of mysterious island is very good, the threshold of its entry is on the high side. Although this style has been welcomed by many players, on the other hand, the game like mysterious island is not friendly to many new players, which indirectly leads to the rejection of the game of adventure and mystery solving. But should this pot really be on mysterious island? I believe that all players who have played this work will not feel this way.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Experience a lonely fantasy adventure, the pioneer of mystery game mysterious island/5b8010be208c450691ecf01c11c52653.jpg" alt="Experience a lonely fantasy adventure, the pioneer of mystery game mysterious island"><br>Witness 2016<br>Concluding remarks<br>Up to now, Lucas art has been acquired, and cyan is still alive. He is still trying to move his works to more platforms, and he is still trying to create new works. Although his glorious historical position has not been inherited by the players, the current situation is very good for a 26 year old game company. Looking at the mysterious Island series again from the current perspective, I believe that most people will feel that it is an out of date work. Both puzzle design and design concept can only be described as low. In such an environment, even if the fire rises, it will definitely be excluded by the players. The golden age of “mysterious island” has passed, and it’s time to put an end to it. Fortunately, Jonathan Bullough’s “witness” takes this will to continue.</p>

    <title>Dream of sailing in the electronic world, past, present and future of navigation games</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/Dream%20of%20sailing%20in%20the%20electronic%20world,%20past,%20present%20and%20future%20of%20navigation%20games/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>There is a famous sentence in the Japanese historical science fiction Galaxy Hero Legend: “our journey is the sea of stars”. Until now, people’s exploration of the universe has not ended, and a group of people with the heart of conquering the sea had the same emotion a few centuries ago.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Dream of sailing in the electronic world, past, present and future of navigation games/b69f85736a8d4109a5d6c0c5ae47dccc.jpg" alt="Dream of sailing in the electronic world, past, present and future of navigation games"><br>Li Bai, a literary magnate, has a poem: “when the wind blows and the waves break, it will help the sea.”. Human beings are really a very contradictory race. They are full of fear in the unknown field, but they will feel especially curious and yearning. It is under the influence of this kind of emotion that a group of brave warriors who dare to challenge themselves to conquer the unknown are born.<br>A few centuries ago, it was not very difficult to become a sailor to explore the sea. With the gradual development and improvement of human civilization, this opportunity was not easily available to ordinary people like us. In order to satisfy those who had a dream of sailing but had no chance to go to sea, various related works emerged as substitutes, such as books and Film and television works emerge in endlessly, and it seems that only video games can provide the best experience for people.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Dream of sailing in the electronic world, past, present and future of navigation games/41969235efc94ee1aaab779ec1fc5d4a.jpg" alt="Dream of sailing in the electronic world, past, present and future of navigation games"><br>    past<br>When it comes to navigation, it is estimated that the first impression of most people is sailing, artillery, pirates, which is also the inherent image of navigation games. From the end of the 15th century to the beginning of the 16th century, people opened up sea routes that could connect all regions of the world. These routes promoted people’s communication and exchange all over the world. Along with the rapid promotion of knowledge and trade, they provided a new breakthrough for the development of human civilization. This period is known as the “era of great navigation” in the future. Such a wonderful and interesting historical background can hardly be made into a game. The first one to carry out this work was the glory of the Japanese manufacturers who were famous for developing historical games in their early years. By their hands, the most prestigious and most famous maritime play in the history of the game, the age of great navigation, was born.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Dream of sailing in the electronic world, past, present and future of navigation games/0bddeb361b5043ccbc2ad3657b69a00d.jpg" alt="Dream of sailing in the electronic world, past, present and future of navigation games"><br>The first generation of the age of great navigation was born in 1991. There are six orthodox works up to now. Each generation has an original story based on historical documents. There is no strict task setting in this series. Players can set up their own navigation teams to explore in various cities, trade with them to obtain funds, or launch wars to gain reputation. In the game, players need to master certain knowledge of navigation, geography, management and trade to operate the whole navigation team. At the same time, they also need to often fight with the pirates. Although the immersion of the game is not very strong, but it is a very detailed restore of all the experiences a navigator should have, which has never appeared in the past Games.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Dream of sailing in the electronic world, past, present and future of navigation games/49b1f9aeb06b4155aec293195c41caf5.jpg" alt="Dream of sailing in the electronic world, past, present and future of navigation games"><br>Regarded as the best series of “the age of great navigation 2” by countless people<br>With “the age of great navigation” as a guide, there are many similar games, such as “the great navigator” from the same developer and later “the king of sea merchants”. Although these games are far less famous than “the age of great navigation”, they also have good game quality. Players who like “the age of great navigation” series will naturally take this as an example Some games can’t let go. And even for the manufacturers of glorious historical games, it has always been a big problem whether they can win or not for a long time. Because of the complexity of the system, the development of such games is difficult, and the audience group is less. Therefore, after a long time, no one will develop games with relevant themes.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Dream of sailing in the electronic world, past, present and future of navigation games/914433a93ffe4ebfbd693ac58fd9b708.jpg" alt="Dream of sailing in the electronic world, past, present and future of navigation games"><br>The follow-up “king of the sea merchants” has excellent pictures but general public praise</p>
<p>In addition to glory, now there is another game company that focuses on historical themes called Ubisoft. Its aerial historical theme action game “Assassin’s Creed” has been astonishing since its birth, but now it is still the most commercial IP of Ubisoft, none of which. As we all know, “Assassin’s Creed” is the most popular one in the series, “Assassin’s Creed 2”. Its trilogy complements the complete adventure story of a generation of Assassin master ejio. With the passage of the plot, the game time also advances. The three generations have jumped from the demise of the Byzantine Empire to the American War of independence, which means that the era of great navigation has ended and the navigation industry has been relatively mature, So in the game, there are some parts of the bridge section of sailing for naval battle.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Dream of sailing in the electronic world, past, present and future of navigation games/6a2d0690f4094facb930194ca9762f05.jpg" alt="Dream of sailing in the electronic world, past, present and future of navigation games"><br>The sea battle system of assassin creed 3 is more experimental<br>This setting gave Ubisoft a lot of inspiration, so in the fourth generation, time went forward for nearly a century, and put it in the 18th century of private plunder, which belongs to the golden age of pirates. “Assassin creed 4: black flag” sets the protagonist as Edward James KENWAY, the grandfather of three generations of protagonist Connor, who was just a sailor on a pirate ship before becoming an assassin. The game puts the story in the West Indies between the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, and the protagonist is a pirate, which means that there will be many elements of navigation. In addition to the general linear tasks, the players can also upgrade and transform the protagonist’s love ship “jackdaw” at will to perform all the activities that a pirate can carry out.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Dream of sailing in the electronic world, past, present and future of navigation games/5c8dcdfa8a7048fa9457aa9ad848b8d6.jpg" alt="Dream of sailing in the electronic world, past, present and future of navigation games"><br>Assassin creed 4: black flag<br>Players can rob every ship they see in the game, and they can form their own caravans to trade around the world, especially for the part of naval battle, no game can match it up to now. In addition to sailing, players can collect sailors for the fleet in various towns, collect treasure maps and find treasures scattered around the world, and sing with other sailors when sailing freely. Several main NPCs in the game refer to the famous pirates in the historical records, and shape them with flesh and blood. The players can experience a pirate story with great sense of substitution in the game. Although the game is far less than the era of great navigation, black flag is definitely the best comprehensive navigation game on the market at present.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Dream of sailing in the electronic world, past, present and future of navigation games/395ea3498f8f483c9db582f4d94769f5.jpg" alt="Dream of sailing in the electronic world, past, present and future of navigation games"><br>Part of the boarding battle was quite enjoyable<br>     future<br>In 2018, Microsoft quietly released a multiplayer online game “the sea of Thieves” with the same theme of pirates. It is worth mentioning that the developer of this game was the “FPS innovator” the developer of 007 golden eye “, which means that they have quite mature experience in the development of first person perspective games, at least on the surface. In the past navigation games, the main operating object of the players is the ship, or the people of a ship, and there has never been a navigation game from the perspective of a single person on the ship. Perhaps in the view of rare, only from this perspective can we get the best navigation experience, but in fact, it is not so much a navigation game as a pirate simulation Device “.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Dream of sailing in the electronic world, past, present and future of navigation games/03da0c4395544f38ac5a73c44db3586f.jpg" alt="Dream of sailing in the electronic world, past, present and future of navigation games"><br>In “the sea of Thieves”, the operation of the sailboat also needs to be meticulous to the individual because it mainly focuses on multi people online. It needs to be steered, controlled by someone, fired by someone and guided by someone. Even if the hole at the bottom of the boat leaks water, it needs to be repaired by someone. In a word, it is very difficult for a person to operate a huge sailing boat smoothly. Although this setting is novel, it sacrifices the experience of playing the game. The system in the game is too detailed, so it is very tedious to play. Although the game has an excellent sense of substitution, if there are no friends, the experience of the game will be very poor. Rare shows a different design scheme for the players and the industry to reduce the threshold for more players to contact this type, but it also proves that this attempt is meaningful with practical actions, but it has not much reference value.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Dream of sailing in the electronic world, past, present and future of navigation games/50e3c50a17314a329fa1b57565b8ae17.jpg" alt="Dream of sailing in the electronic world, past, present and future of navigation games"><br>It needs to be combined with a lot of common sense<br>Since then, I haven’t seen any other navigation games. It’s undeniable that although the theme is interesting, few people are willing to enjoy the pleasure of navigation quietly in this impetuous era. The market downturn also leads to the fact that the theme is only a very small theme.<br>Concluding remarks<br>The attempt of “the sea of Thieves” on the first person multiplayer online is completely consistent with the true spirit of navigation, which is undoubtedly risky, but whether it can be successful or not needs to be verified by the market. Obviously this time they failed, but they are not sure that they can find a better solution in the near future. At least in the way of experience, people have found a way to create the best game experience, and also have a high-quality game mode, hoping that this category will not be buried by the market in the future. After all, there are not many games that can experience the conquest of the sea on the market.</p>

    <title>Enjoy the elegant trajectory of bullets in the air and the use of bullet time in the game</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/Enjoy%20the%20elegant%20trajectory%20of%20bullets%20in%20the%20air%20and%20the%20use%20of%20bullet%20time%20in%20the%20game/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Slow motion, a special effect shooting technique, often appears in the field of film and television, especially in various popular action films. Generally, slow motion will appear in the highly tense segments of action movies, which can play an increasingly important role in improving the adrenaline level of the audience. When it comes to the most classic slow motion scenes in the film history, it is estimated that most people will think of the plot of Neo hiding from bullets in “matrix” played by Chino Reeves in those years. It is precisely because of this plot that this slow motion shooting technique is also known as “bullet time”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Enjoy the elegant trajectory of bullets in the air and the use of bullet time in the game/8a65d9f019fc4d9f8da9f2e81200911d.jpg" alt="Enjoy the elegant trajectory of bullets in the air and the use of bullet time in the game"><br>Later, the screen effect of video games gradually improved, and some games seemed to be in an action blockbuster in the overall experience, and the cinematic narrative and performance techniques began to be popular in the field of games, among which, naturally, the “bullet time” is a very eye-catching performance technique. Unlike movies, most of the time, players We can control the opening and closing of bullet time by ourselves, and decide when to slow motion has the final say.<br>The origin of<br>This technique is called “bullet time” perhaps because there are slow flying bullets and slow shots moving around the protagonist in the classic bridge section of matrix. Before this name was born, there were also the names of “time cutting” or “time freezing” in the film and television industry. The origin of “bullet time” can be traced back to the 1870s, when a photographer named Edward mibridge explored the instantaneity of shooting. At that time, the governor of California raised the question: can four legs of an animal leave the ground at the same time? For this question, some people say yes, some people say no, and they also say each other has its own reason. But if we look at it from the perspective of modern people, we will be more puzzled. It’s not about whether we can, but why we argue about it.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Enjoy the elegant trajectory of bullets in the air and the use of bullet time in the game/b0c606dcad174cfc96d8b243f592cf08.jpg" alt="Enjoy the elegant trajectory of bullets in the air and the use of bullet time in the game"><br>Edward mibridge<br>The reason for the controversy is that some people have proposed that “quadruped may be able to leave the ground at the same time when it is moving at high speed”, and the thought and cognition of people at that time is obviously not enough to solve this problem, otherwise there will be no subsequent stories. In order to test this problem, Edward arranged many cameras on the racetrack of the racetrack, and each camera had a string across the racetrack. As long as the horse passed here, breaking the rope can trigger the shutter on the camera, so as to achieve the effect of continuous shooting. When the results come out, it turns out that animals can leave the ground with four legs at the same time. This shooting technique not only provides inspiration for later films, but also enables people to have a cognition of the speed and advance and retreat of actions through this experiment.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Enjoy the elegant trajectory of bullets in the air and the use of bullet time in the game/766c069fee5b4af18f782b6e7b7a2424.jpg" alt="Enjoy the elegant trajectory of bullets in the air and the use of bullet time in the game"><br>Not just horses, but most of the self-sufficient creatures that can move at high speed</p>
<p>In any case, in the early years to achieve the effect of “bullet time” in the film is not an easy and expensive technology, but in dynamic animation or games to achieve this effect is much easier. According to the data, the first game in history that uses the bullet time effect is the RPG game “starquest: rescue at Rigel” launched by epxy company in 1980. Because of its science fiction background, it allows players to realize the bullet time effect in the game with the help of biochemical transplant device. But it’s worth mentioning that before the movie “matrix”, data showed that only this game used this effect.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Enjoy the elegant trajectory of bullets in the air and the use of bullet time in the game/31fea650dddc493987a107bf071bff84.jpg" alt="Enjoy the elegant trajectory of bullets in the air and the use of bullet time in the game"><br>Starquest: rescue at Rigel game cover<br>After the “matrix” hit, the concept of “bullet time” began to spread, and many developers began to add this design to their own games. As mentioned above, bullet time is usually used in action games. It is worth mentioning that whether it is fighting, shooting or sports games, it can be called action games. In historical records, the first game to use modern bullet time effect is FPS game “Requiem: Revenge angel” released by retroism in 1999. Players often appear “bullet time” when fighting to avoid the enemy’s firepower and aim at the enemy more easily.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Enjoy the elegant trajectory of bullets in the air and the use of bullet time in the game/6da9df0dcacc4e08a8ee7bd61198dc9e.jpg" alt="Enjoy the elegant trajectory of bullets in the air and the use of bullet time in the game"><br>“Requiem: Angel of revenge” is not famous though it is classic<br>And the game works that really carry forward the design of “bullet time” must have been heard by players from all walks of life, even if they haven’t played, “Marx Payne”, a work of both game name and human name. This is a TPS game. In the game, players can hold two guns like matrix or heroes, jump out of the bunker, dodge bullets and pour fire at the enemy. In this state, the game will start the bullet time mode. Players can clearly see the trajectory of bullets, and the surrounding sound effects will slow down Slow, but only the response of the protagonist can still be as usual. This kind of bloody fighting mode is really eye-catching. It’s like watching a movie directed by John Woo. In the era when video games didn’t use motion capture technology, few people can surpass the action and music and painting performance brought by Marx Payne to this day.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Enjoy the elegant trajectory of bullets in the air and the use of bullet time in the game/9d9689d7244848d09fd0c4b737f7b9ac.jpg" alt="Enjoy the elegant trajectory of bullets in the air and the use of bullet time in the game"><br>By the third generation of the series, the combat system was excellent<br>In the field of racing games, the system of bullet time is not common now. In the earlier series of “the best flying car”, there is a system called “fast device”, which can also be called “fast response” system. This system was first launched in the ninth work of the series “the most wanted”. The purpose of this system is that the proportion of the police and bandits chasing is high, and the action is strong. Players often focus on the car with the police and ignore the road conditions, and the situation of hitting the car or stepping on the spiked belt often occurs. The existence of this system is to let players in a short time of slow motion Under the rapid response, players can easily avoid obstacles or pass through the more difficult corners, and the price is to exit the “fast device” and then find that the speed of the vehicle will be greatly reduced. I believe that no matter who first touches the system, they will think it’s something that can accelerate when they look at the name, but when they open it, they find that the speed doesn’t increase but decreases.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Enjoy the elegant trajectory of bullets in the air and the use of bullet time in the game/d4be38bc2b5d4c8c993b7ee1348b437e.jpg" alt="Enjoy the elegant trajectory of bullets in the air and the use of bullet time in the game"><br>The orange metering slot above the dashboard is the “flying device”<br>Among all the games using bullet time, the most creative and favorite one is super hot, which is an FPS game. But the most unusual thing is that the full name of the game is in the state of “bullet time”. As long as the player stays in the original place, the time will pass very slowly. Once the perspective is rotated or moved, the time will be right Constant flow. The rule of the game is that no matter the protagonist and the enemy are killed in one shot, the protagonist needs one to many, and the enemy has all kinds of knives, guns, sticks and clubs in his hands. Using the characteristics of bullet time, the protagonist can plan his own actions in slow motion, push forward the time bit by bit and use all the objects around him to fight back. The trajectory of the bullet can be predicted to be chopped off, or thrown props to offset Block, or even split in two with a samurai knife. It is worth mentioning that when each level is completed, the game will replay the player’s actions at a normal speed, giving a feeling of operation like an action superstar.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Enjoy the elegant trajectory of bullets in the air and the use of bullet time in the game/ca36c6b2e5574528950dee463be2a968.jpg" alt="Enjoy the elegant trajectory of bullets in the air and the use of bullet time in the game"><br>In the first person, it’s very exciting to feel the bullet passing by in slow motion<br>    concluding remarks<br>In the author’s mind, the scene most suitable for the combination of bullet time is the effect when the objects are destroyed except for the flight path of various bullets, such as the scene of close-up shooting and glass fragmentation in various games, especially the scene of explosion. The effect of slowly expanding the sense of tear is irresistible. Maybe this is the so-called “explosion is art”. In fact, no matter in the movie or in the game, the most important role of bullet time is to help the players to savor the moments of various wonderful scenes, which can make the scenes that are very hot in themselves more exciting and exciting.</p>

    <title>Expose the ugliness of capitalism, the unknown story behind the classic game the millionaire</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/Expose%20the%20ugliness%20of%20capitalism,%20the%20unknown%20story%20behind%20the%20classic%20game%20the%20millionaire/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>It is believed that most of the players will come into contact with a desktop game called “millionaire” in their childhood. Because of its simple and easy playing method, its rich content and features, it still has a lot of fans today, and it is a regular customer of each board game shop. Its later electronic games adapted and produced by Daewoo software are popular among Chinese players Famous for “millionaire 4”. Whether it’s a board game or a video game, “millionaire” is a puzzle game suitable for all age players. It’s an enlightenment work for many younger players on economic cognition.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Expose the ugliness of capitalism, the unknown story behind the classic game the millionaire/5ee7580c37054dbd920bf6897cfe4a5e.jpg" alt="Expose the ugliness of capitalism, the unknown story behind the classic game the millionaire"><br>We all know that the most direct way to win in monopoly is to buy and develop every piece of land on the board, and charge other players a high “toll”. The game board has four lines, representing the “four streets”. I still remember the horror of being dominated by the “Hotel” in the whole street when I played with my little friends. However, in fact, the game’s playing method is already contrary to the original design idea. The idea of game inventors is far from the simple idea that players play the role of landlord to kill each other.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Expose the ugliness of capitalism, the unknown story behind the classic game the millionaire/d400bf2f49e943238fa9137dc58d8f37.jpg" alt="Expose the ugliness of capitalism, the unknown story behind the classic game the millionaire"></p>
<p>#Progress and poverty<br>The origin of the story goes back to the 19th century. There is a political economist named Henry George. Because of his poor family, he went out to do odd jobs when he was very young. He didn’t have any hard work until his youth. Therefore, he has a clear understanding of poverty and the hard life of the people at the bottom. From the middle of the 19th century to the beginning of the 20th century, the United States just ended the civil war. As a result, it has made rapid progress in economy and technology, and established free economy and market system. As a result, the economic strength of the whole United States has also grown significantly and gradually become a major power.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Expose the ugliness of capitalism, the unknown story behind the classic game the millionaire/d32ce0c5df4647a7ac37d6a0a8430be3.jpg" alt="Expose the ugliness of capitalism, the unknown story behind the classic game the millionaire"><br>However, the growth of economic strength does not mean that all people become rich. Because of the intervention of capitalists, the rich become richer and richer, while the poor become poorer and poorer, and the gap between the rich and the poor is suddenly opened. In order to make a living, the poor have to bear the contempt of the rich, but also encourage them to pay for their labor force to make a living. In the long run, there will inevitably be various contradictions, and the crime rate will rise. All of this was in George’s eyes. He began to think about how this huge difference came into being. For this reason, he read the works of many old economists and personally visited all parts of the United States. Finally, he came to a conclusion: the key to widening the gap between the rich and the poor was the prevailing private ownership of land in the United States at that time.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Expose the ugliness of capitalism, the unknown story behind the classic game the millionaire/0423c085614147f8a51097677022a858.jpg" alt="Expose the ugliness of capitalism, the unknown story behind the classic game the millionaire"><br>Henry became an economist. He put forward his view to the outside world: as more and more land is developed, the land will continue to increase in value. It is easy for the rich to buy land, while the poor need more and more money to buy land. In addition, most of the poor hold the concept of “growing poorer and living”, and the population is also increasing, so they compete Competition has become fierce, and the wages of the poor will be diluted by the company. The reality is indeed developing in the direction predicted by Henry. According to this point of view, he wrote and launched his own theoretical work progress and poverty to express his opposition to the private ownership of land. As soon as this book was published, it caused a sensation in the whole United States, triggered public opinion in the whole society, and finally people have a cognition of the reality.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Expose the ugliness of capitalism, the unknown story behind the classic game the millionaire/e83a6d65a1584893a2dde9d326118d3a.jpg" alt="Expose the ugliness of capitalism, the unknown story behind the classic game the millionaire"><br>The cover of progress and poverty</p>
<h1 id="“landlord-game”"><a href="#“landlord-game”" class="headerlink" title="“landlord game”"></a>“landlord game”</h1><p>Among the millions of people affected by Henry’s work is a media worker named Elizabeth Maggie. She was a feminist, a woman with a strong personality. At that time, feminists were not so pompous as they are now. They were just fighting for the women who suffered from the oppression of their humble status.<br>By chance, she came into contact with the work progress and poverty. She agreed with Henry’s work. At the same time, in order to further verify Henry’s theory, she designed a desktop game. In this game, she distributed the chessboard into several identical squares to represent “land” and “Railway”. The four corners of the chessboard are various public facilities and Landmarks, considering the high crime rate at that time, one of the four landmarks is “prison”, the whole chessboard is square, and the playing rule is to roll dice to control the movement of the chessboard and act according to the contents of the chessboard.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Expose the ugliness of capitalism, the unknown story behind the classic game the millionaire/81c53f0c5e5c4aca9368e2a20e9682f0.jpg" alt="Expose the ugliness of capitalism, the unknown story behind the classic game the millionaire"><br>Elizabeth Maggie<br>Elizabeth named the game “the landlord’s game”, which is the prototype of “the millionaire” or “strong hand chess”. The most unknown thing is that Elizabeth made two sets of rules for the game. The first one is the most familiar way to play the game of land acquisition, toll collection and landowner. This rule is named “monopoly” “. So why doesn’t anyone know the second set of rules? The reason is simple: because the rules are “not fun.”. Elisabeth named the second set of rules “prosperity”. The game is played by any one player’s land, whose ownership and income are shared by all players. Until the player with the least capital of the manufacturer also earns twice of the initial capital, the game can be declared over, and all players can win and achieve a win-win situation.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Expose the ugliness of capitalism, the unknown story behind the classic game the millionaire/b2cb09875ab04b779b273a81c1e60ec4.jpg" alt="Expose the ugliness of capitalism, the unknown story behind the classic game the millionaire"><br>The first edition of “landlord game” color board<br>No matter from which point of view, the second set of rules is not as attractive as the first set of rules, but actually the second set of rules is what Elizabeth wants to really express. This set of rules can be said to be the epitome of Henry’s theory, refusing to privatize the land, and giving back the profits gained from the development of the land to the society, rather than simply enriching the capital family There is no difference between straightness and autocracy. Elizabeth applied for a patent for the game she designed, and specifically stated in the application that “the game aims to show the adverse impact of land monopoly on the economy and the feasibility of using land value tax as a remedy”.</p>
<h1 id="“real-estate-tycoon”"><a href="#“real-estate-tycoon”" class="headerlink" title="“real estate tycoon”"></a>“real estate tycoon”</h1><p>Now that the game is finished, we have to find a way to promote the game. It’s hard to imagine that when the game was originally designed, it was first spread among adults. Elizabeth hopes to let more children realize the disadvantages of private ownership of land through the game. After all, education starts from dolls. Elizabeth and several friends set up a company to be responsible for the production and distribution of the game. In 1909, Elizabeth found Parker Brothers, the most famous toy manufacturer at that time, and hoped that they could help promote their own games, but they refused. It is said that the rules of the game of landlord are complicated and obscure. It is also said that the game is too political for children to play. Although the Parker Brothers refused to release the game, the game still achieved great success in the public, and Elizabeth’s “landlord game” also released various versions.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Expose the ugliness of capitalism, the unknown story behind the classic game the millionaire/f25da8e604f549e38203388b05d2ba94.jpg" alt="Expose the ugliness of capitalism, the unknown story behind the classic game the millionaire"><br>Map version of landlord game<br>By the 1930s, the United States had a famous “Great Depression” event, so many people became unemployed. One of the former water heater salesmen, Charles dallow, came into contact with the popular “landlord game” in a visit, but he didn’t get the idea from Parker company through the issue: he decided to simplify the rules of the game, redesign the game, and repackage the “landlord game” to Parker Brothers.<br>The simplified “landlord game” is more like a role-playing game of “being a politician” for players, which was directly adopted by Parker Brothers. This version is later “monopoly”. Relying on the ability of Parker Brothers, the game became famous easily. Charles “should” became the “founder” of the game mode, and became a millionaire Weng, it seems that the concept of “plagiarism” existed at that time. Elizabeth’s anger at the news was not that her works had been copied, but that the real estate tycoon only had the rule of “monopoly”, which was equal to whether Henry George’s thought had been determined, but Elizabeth had no choice.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Expose the ugliness of capitalism, the unknown story behind the classic game the millionaire/b508f147f13f494bb92053f9fad81123.jpg" alt="Expose the ugliness of capitalism, the unknown story behind the classic game the millionaire"><br>The first edition of “real estate tycoon” not only simplifies the chessboard, but also the design of objects is very handy<br>    concluding remarks<br>In this way, “real estate tycoon” as a pure game without any thought has been handed down. Elizabeth’s “landlord game” is slowly submerged by the long history. Fortunately, Elizabeth later proved the ugly behavior of Parker Brothers and Charles in the court through her patent. The truth can be revealed, but “real estate tycoon” is helpless It’s hard to change the idea that Charles is the “founder”. Although the real estate tycoon admits that the founder is Elizabeth, it’s very vague, so as to keep the company’s reputation.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Expose the ugliness of capitalism, the unknown story behind the classic game the millionaire/f24cb092c4ea44b8bafd8e8bd539fbf1.jpg" alt="Expose the ugliness of capitalism, the unknown story behind the classic game the millionaire"><br>The Parker Brothers were acquired by Hasbro, and now they have real estate tycoon<br>When we played Monopoly in childhood, we didn’t seem to think so much about it. We just enjoyed the pure fun of playing games and the blood of fighting with others. The reason why monopoly kept growing was because it showed the real miniature of modern society through a small piece of chess paper. It was not only helpful for children’s cognition, but also helpful for children’s cognition It’s really fun as a game.</p>

    <url>/2019/11/08/Experience%20the%20fantasy%20adventure%20created%20by%20myself,%20and%20trigger%20the%20independent%20game%20bright%20traveler%20of%20the%20industry/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Pixel wind, in the eyes of many people, is a kind of art style that is both retro and childish, but in the eyes of many game developers, it can be accepted by the players in a very people-friendly way, and at the same time, it can show some unique beauty that can only be presented by pixel wind without losing tension. With the pixel style, this game means that every moving thing in the game needs the author to split the animation into one frame for creation, which is no less tedious than the modeling of other 3D games. In the independent game of pixel style, Fez, teraria and other games are the leaders.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Experience the fantasy adventure created by myself, and trigger the independent game bright traveler of the industry/8b07f04d3dad4c0c87e7a84a171cdf66.jpg" alt="Experience the fantasy adventure created by myself, and trigger the independent game bright traveler of the industry"><br>If you want to succeed as a pixel wind independent game, you can either have fun online with your little friends, or you can win the attention of the players by relying on your outstanding creativity and quality. Even so, there will be some unlucky people who don’t have this blessing. Even if they are well-made, they still can’t get too high popularity. Most of these works are called “good or not”. Today’s story’s protagonist “the bright traveller” is such an existence, and behind the scenes of this game, there is a unknown story.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Experience the fantasy adventure created by myself, and trigger the independent game bright traveler of the industry/908c6b0086d94fc08d906572e417edaf.jpg" alt="Experience the fantasy adventure created by myself, and trigger the independent game bright traveler of the industry"></p>
<p>#”Gao Fu Shuai” in pixel world<br>The bright traveler, released in March 2016, is a retro style action role-playing game in which the player will play an unknown brave against the dark forces in a damaged continent and explore the unknown secrets hidden under the continent. The main process of the game is divided into roaming on the big map and exploring into the underground maze or palace. This kind of playing method is very similar to the early “Legend of Zelda” series. The mode of the game is basically the same. There are many places worth mentioning about this game, and each place can be called “the finishing touch”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Experience the fantasy adventure created by myself, and trigger the independent game bright traveler of the industry/268f57a855ba4dc1b48d1bc1389a990a.jpg" alt="Experience the fantasy adventure created by myself, and trigger the independent game bright traveler of the industry"><br>Although the 16 pixel wind is used in the game’s screen, the details of the screen can be circled, such as the particle effect of the lightsaber in the protagonist’s hand when cutting hard objects, and the blood effect of the enemy when dying. The overall style of the game has the feeling of post apocalypse. There are not only various ancient civilizations and ancient relics, but also various elements of science fiction. For example, various science fiction electronic laboratories and mechanisms, lightsabers and light guns in the hands of the protagonists, etc. form a very magical style between them. It will be weird when viewed alone, but when put together, it will feel weird all blend into one harmonious whole.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Experience the fantasy adventure created by myself, and trigger the independent game bright traveler of the industry/b39a844f5f7147fd953516c0f72895ae.jpg" alt="Experience the fantasy adventure created by myself, and trigger the independent game bright traveler of the industry"><br>There are two biggest two points in the game. One is that the perspective and core playing method of the game are very similar to the legend of Zelda, and the hard words are most like the triangle power of the gods. But unlike Zelda, the fighting system in the game is in a refreshing and fast-paced style. The weapons and their own attributes of the protagonist cannot grow, so the damage of the weapons and the blood volume of the enemy are always fixed Yes, it’s the same as the Zelda series. In the later stage, players can use chips to unlock more actions and moves to deal with various situations, such as using lightsabers to rebound the enemy’s long-range attacks, using fast penetration skills to instantly approach the enemy and inflict damage, etc. with a good sense of attack, players can feel quite happy fighting experience.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Experience the fantasy adventure created by myself, and trigger the independent game bright traveler of the industry/be0bbf26f3044fb89363c96114d6c27b.jpg" alt="Experience the fantasy adventure created by myself, and trigger the independent game bright traveler of the industry"><br>The other highlight is that there is no dialogue in the full name of the game. The full name of the game is only expressed in the form of images. Even when talking with NPC, there are only a few pictures. What happens requires players to supplement their own brains. No text will appear in the scene or even in the UI. Only some hints on the operation will be expressed in the form of text, so even if There is no Chinese in the game and it does not affect the normal play. Combined with the stories and details of each NPC in the game, we can arouse the players’ reverie. From the two minutes of the opening but without a dialogue, we can know what the protagonist seems to be looking for. He has a relatively serious disease, which seems to be to cure his disease and take a risk. Every time after the fight with boss, the protagonist coughs up blood and faints to the ground. There is always a feeling that he will die at any time. This is not the need of the plot, but the author of the game deliberately for it, because he has the same experience as the protagonist of the game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Experience the fantasy adventure created by myself, and trigger the independent game bright traveler of the industry/8f8b6fc5098a4955bb1a0764f12912e3.jpg" alt="Experience the fantasy adventure created by myself, and trigger the independent game bright traveler of the industry"></p>
<p>#It’s not fun<br>The author of “the light traveler” is Alex Preston. All the passages in the game about the protagonist’s death at any time are deliberately implied by him. Because he has congenital heart disease, his purpose is to express his emotion wandering on the edge of death to the players. Alex had suffered from open heart surgery since he was a child, and a few years later he put a pacemaker on his body. He needs to go to the hospital to check his heart every six months. He needs to pay great attention to his diet and take a lot of pills on time. He knows that he may die at any time carefully. Alex is an art major, and he has been fond of video games since childhood. His cousin Ryan Amos and Alex usually do the most things together, that is, play games together. One day, he had a strange thought. He said that he didn’t know how long he would live, so he might as well try to do something to share it with the world proud before he died. After communicating with his cousin, he had the idea of making a game. But he didn’t want to do it carelessly. Since he wanted to do it, he had to do it like that.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Experience the fantasy adventure created by myself, and trigger the independent game bright traveler of the industry/a1714c361d6e4f6e9b6496b3553cdb3c.jpg" alt="Experience the fantasy adventure created by myself, and trigger the independent game bright traveler of the industry"><br>With the help of his cousin, Alex got to know Bo Blythe, a pretty good programmer. The two decided to start the cooperation because their views on many aspects met at once. The game gradually became a serious project from only a few sketches at the beginning, and with Bo’s contact, they met another programmer, teddy diefenbach, which was their whole team. Thanks to his family, friends and doctors who treated him, Alex decided to name his team “heart machine” and began crowdfunding the game with KickStarter. The game’s crowdfunding target is $27000, and after a month, they raised a total of more than $645000, which made Alexei and his team ecstatic. This not only enabled the game to be completed, but also helped expand the scale of the game and recruited several more people to work together. In the end, the game was successfully sold, and in just a few days, it earned a million level of revenue. With its excellent operating touch and unique art design and style, it won the praise of the players. Today, the praise rate in the store is about 94%.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Experience the fantasy adventure created by myself, and trigger the independent game bright traveler of the industry/831225a243e444b9aae6762c421a0bc1.jpg" alt="Experience the fantasy adventure created by myself, and trigger the independent game bright traveler of the industry"><br>    concluding remarks<br>It is worth mentioning that the game has announced the upcoming adaptation of animation at the beginning of this year. Alex has never felt so happy in his playing days. After finishing the work, he still wants to keep going until the end. Playing games made him get to know more people. They had a common goal but had different topics, which made Alex’s daily life less painful. At the same time, many players in KickStarter paid attention to whether their players sent care and greetings, which made him get a lot of comfort in mind.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Experience the fantasy adventure created by myself, and trigger the independent game bright traveler of the industry/def652be231149d59d55cb7529dc5b8a.jpg" alt="Experience the fantasy adventure created by myself, and trigger the independent game bright traveler of the industry"><br>For the final product of this game, he himself has expressed his satisfaction. At least his purpose of trying to convey his ideas to the players through the game is to achieve it. For him, perhaps integrating the pain of life into his daily work can make him unable to choose to escape, but can become his motivation.</p>

    <title>For more than 40 years, what kind of game has Star Wars never tried</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/For%20more%20than%2040%20years,%20what%20kind%20of%20game%20has%20Star%20Wars%20never%20tried/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In 1977, an unknown science fiction film was released in the United States. This film is a rare space war theme on the market. Almost none of the whole film from the director to the actor can be called “Star”. In the early years, due to the proliferation of science fiction works, people did not have much interest in this work from the beginning. But it didn’t come to pass. After the movie was released, it caused huge repercussions. The high evaluation of the explosion made it directly refresh the box office record of American films, and later became an indispensable part of American popular culture. Until now, its influence is still high. This is star wars, a popular and meaningful name.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/For more than 40 years, what kind of game has Star Wars never tried/eb58990b2cfb44419ba5f0f0779638d3.jpg" alt="For more than 40 years, what kind of game has Star Wars never tried"><br>Film and television adaptation works have always had a relatively easy market, especially in the early years of the home computer platform special honor to obtain a relatively ideal market, and “Star Wars” as a very influential work is naturally unable to jump out of the fate of being adapted into a game. As a science fiction movie with a huge world outlook and many elements, it can be made into a game by picking out any action element in the movie, and Star Wars does, and it still hasn’t stopped until now.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/For more than 40 years, what kind of game has Star Wars never tried/af4375c30db040c09eb0d72b9f1f36c4.jpg" alt="For more than 40 years, what kind of game has Star Wars never tried"></p>
<h1 id="scenario-reproduction"><a href="#scenario-reproduction" class="headerlink" title="scenario reproduction"></a>scenario reproduction</h1><p>If we want to talk about all the video games of Star Wars since ancient times, we may only talk about half of them for a while. Star Wars was born in the 1970s, when video games and home computers were even in their infancy, and most of the Star Wars games were logged into the arcade platform at that time, which was pushed by yadali company When I came out of Atari 2600 home game console, there was a great wave of console games at that time, and various kinds of game works emerged in an endless stream, no matter the first party or the third party. According to the available information, the first Star Wars game was born in 1983. It was five years after the first movie was released, so the game was named Star Wars: Arcade edition.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/For more than 40 years, what kind of game has Star Wars never tried/2b8456850d12446d97ba7ed4cf8ddc5b.jpg" alt="For more than 40 years, what kind of game has Star Wars never tried"><br>Yadali 2600<br>Due to the limitation of its function, the game scene of yadali 2600 that can get the best performance is space. It only needs a black background and a few white dots as stars. This is a perfect space scene. Draw a color straight line at will, which is an exciting light. Therefore, yadali is particularly fond of space themed games because they can make more Focus on adding other effects to the scene. This transplanted “Star Wars” game also sets the game background in space, and it is a first person simulated flight driving work. Setting the scene in the first film of the rebel resistance to the attack of the Empire, it’s hard to achieve the perfect arcade restoration in yadali, but fortunately, it’s only a flexible perspective The Pseudo 3D effect is realized by lines. In addition, the game of yadali generally requires the players to play their own imagination, so this work also creates a fairly good game experience for the players.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/For more than 40 years, what kind of game has Star Wars never tried/c45bbdba1ed04d4982c00997d23f0fd7.jpg" alt="For more than 40 years, what kind of game has Star Wars never tried"><br>Star Wars: Arcade Edition<br>Since then, most of the games on the yadali platform are basically to restore part of the bridge in a movie, and most of them are flying shooting. They are basically transplanted from the arcade, but they have different playing methods and modes. Then came the period when Nintendo dominated the hegemony, the game picture became better, and the capacity of the game was larger than before, so the host of Nintendo has the ability to realize the process of using a game to restore a movie completely. The first “Star Wars” game of Nintendo FC platform was born in 1987. It restores the whole story flow of the first movie with the type of horizontal action passing that became the trend at that time. However, I don’t know why this game is only released in Japan. It is worth mentioning that in this work, there are also some first person flying shots of the Millennium Falcon in the horizontal movement process, but the experience is not very good. Although this work is the beginning of a new era, it does not have a good performance.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/For more than 40 years, what kind of game has Star Wars never tried/5a2af121563741e38156d59df90e5238.jpg" alt="For more than 40 years, what kind of game has Star Wars never tried"><br>FC Star Wars</p>
<p>#New ideas<br>Since then, the vast majority of Star Wars games are basically horizontal action types, and according to the release time of subsequent films, almost every movie has been adapted into a game and landed on most of the game consoles at that time. Most of the highlights of these games are the same, except that players are allowed to control the popular characters in the game, or restore the famous scenes in the movie on the basis of horizontal action. They have basically the same modeling design and game music with the movie, and the level design of the game is relatively good. But the only constant is the difficulty of the game. Since the first work on FC, more than ten works have this relatively high difficulty, which can’t be blown black. Although the difficulty of the current game is generally low, even from the perspective of that time, these games are still not very simple works.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/For more than 40 years, what kind of game has Star Wars never tried/9fa6e3c1cd9b4810a14cd7a08ce8e42d.jpg" alt="For more than 40 years, what kind of game has Star Wars never tried"><br>SFC Super Star Wars<br>As time goes back to the 3D era, 3D images make the game more expressive and create the feeling of coming to the movie bridge. For the first time, players can attack enemies at will with lightsabers and blasters. At the same time, it seems that players are tired of adapting the game, so many manufacturers choose the world view of Star Wars Design original plot. Among them, the Star Wars: Samurai of the Old Republic series launched by the legendary RPG developer BioWare is the representative. There are three works in the series, two of which are stand-alone and the other is MMORPG. The game adopts the semi instant turn system. The plot design is based on the original film and is written independently. With the development experience of “door of Bode” and “night without winter” in the early years, The plot performance of “samurai of the Old Republic” is definitely the biggest plus item of the game. Although it is controversial in the eyes of some players, the quality of the game is beyond doubt, and it won the best game of the year.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/For more than 40 years, what kind of game has Star Wars never tried/ea4de4d126e240c29e9a085de4895a32.jpg" alt="For more than 40 years, what kind of game has Star Wars never tried"><br>Star Wars: Warriors of the Old Republic<br>It seems that after entering the 3D era, Star Wars has really found the most suitable position for itself, and finally ushered in the most glorious period. As one of the largest popular cultures overseas, in order to be able to accept new fans, Star Wars has also tried various changes, such as launching the online game “front line” series, which supports multiple people, and is suitable for young people “LEGO Star Wars” series and so on. It seems to many players that “frontline” series is the most suitable game type to restore the movie experience. However, due to the recession of business, LucasArts, who controls the game copyright of “Star Wars”, was dissolved by the parent company Disney, and then the copyright was handed over to ea. EA made the “frontline” series come back to life again, and “Pro family” by itself Son “battlefield” series of scale development, will “Star Wars: front line” to create a game scale no less than “battlefield”, the same is a large battlefield, also is the same multi habitat joint operation, and use their own frost engine development, with no less than the effect of the film, it seems that “Star Wars” finally ushered in the game industry should have the attitude.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/For more than 40 years, what kind of game has Star Wars never tried/c8138eb3884748b4a6ac1dd1f49ca851.jpg" alt="For more than 40 years, what kind of game has Star Wars never tried"><br>Resurrected Star Wars: the front<br>    concluding remarks<br>However, everything came a little late, and the loyal fans of Star Wars series are no longer as many as they used to be. The discussion enthusiasm of movies and games is far less than ever. Even though the quality of the front line of Star Wars is better, it has not been able to maintain the enthusiasm for a long time in front of battlefield. However, in Star Wars: front line 2, due to the problem of micro trading, it has been directly lowered The evaluation of the game, only a short time after the sale ushered in the promotion.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/For more than 40 years, what kind of game has Star Wars never tried/6ff6345a392e4589b3cdb48dcc01b6ce.jpg" alt="For more than 40 years, what kind of game has Star Wars never tried"><br>Star Wars Jedi: the fall of the order<br>Although for the old fans, “Star Wars” may not be as dazzling as it used to be, but he has never left, just waiting for the fans silently, the movie is, the game is. Now the new work of star wars will return to the traditional single player game after many years, and it will be a very popular “soul like” game. Star Wars Jedi: the fall of the samurai is in charge of the rebirth entertainment of Titan fall and apex hero under EA, at least in terms of the quality of the game, but this is also rebirth entertainment joining EA After that, I tried to authorize the development of the game for the first time, and it was also their first non FPS game. I hope that this time I can have a stable play. In fact, the setting of Star Wars is very suitable for the “soul like” game, and there are few companies that can play the game for Star Wars.</p>

    <title>From 2D boy to tomorrow company, the story behind the puzzle game stick to the world</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/From%202D%20boy%20to%20tomorrow%20company,%20the%20story%20behind%20the%20puzzle%20game%20stick%20to%20the%20world/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>As early as ten years ago, there was no concept of “independent game” in the game circle at that time, but there would inevitably be differences between masterpieces and skits, which we call “mini game”. In 2008, I finally got the first computer in my life, but unfortunately, my family didn’t allow the Internet. In those years, if you want to play games, you can’t help yourself. You can only find friends with nets around you. I get the news of the game through the game magazine, and then I give my friend a U disk to help download. At that time, if the capacity of the U disk is installed in a large work, it will be full, so the mini games with small size and fun playing methods are particularly favored by the author. Such excellent works as “dasbank”, “Shanke”, and “creation” (I don’t know how it is all EA) have left a deep impression on the author, which is still fresh in my memory up to now, but one of them is a puzzle game called “sticky world”, which is particularly favored by the pen makers.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From 2D boy to tomorrow company, the story behind the puzzle game stick to the world/af142110ad0c413290c7ebb93b904697.jpg" alt="From 2D boy to tomorrow company, the story behind the puzzle game stick to the world"><br>Speaking of “sticky world”, it’s estimated that most people will have heard the name even if they haven’t played it. This independent game launched in 2008 has caused quite a stir in the whole game circle. With its unique game style and novel game playing methods, it has obtained the consistent high scores of all media, and has become the most comprehensive independent puzzle game with the highest average score in the game history, and has been up to now There is no one to surpass every day. Since then, 2dboy, the game’s developer, has never launched a sequel to sticky world, and its official website has never been updated.<br>2D Boy<br>Kyle Gabler is the founder of 2dboy studio. Before the establishment of the game studio, he worked in EA. His works include action game Simpsons and PC Game Sims 2, which are logged into Nintendo’s Wii console. In total, he has worked in EA for three years. After leaving EA, 2dboy studio was set up by colleagues who had worked together. Their goal is to play games that everyone can play and no one has ever played, and the great success of sticky world proved that they did. In my opinion, “sticky world” is a puzzle game with physical elements in name, but in fact, it is difficult to define it clearly. After all, in the whole game history, the puzzle game with such unique style and plot is really unprecedented. Although the plot of the game is not understood by people after the game is opened, it coordinates with the atmosphere of BGM and the scene Dye makes all the players who have played have a kind of inexplicable emotion.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From 2D boy to tomorrow company, the story behind the puzzle game stick to the world/d671c01ca3894d7f883e9ab13e8b90bb.jpg" alt="From 2D boy to tomorrow company, the story behind the puzzle game stick to the world"><br>The play method of the game is to control a kind of creature named goo (or “goo bean bag”, “goo ball”) to connect them into a tower or bridge and guide the remaining goo to the air intake pipe. When the guided goo reaches the specified number, it will be counted as passing the customs. There are five chapters in the game, 47 levels in total. Each chapter has different themes, and new content will be added. It is worth mentioning that Kyle, the producer, is also a composer. All BGM in the game is composed by him. I believe that every player who has played will be deeply impressed by the BGM of sticky world.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From 2D boy to tomorrow company, the story behind the puzzle game stick to the world/a42a2ba321c94ae7b5d062b639d0397a.jpg" alt="From 2D boy to tomorrow company, the story behind the puzzle game stick to the world"><br>Although the overall painting style of the game is bright in color, it is also a bit weird. Obviously, the characters in the game are so cute, but there is a dark atmosphere. Although there is no horror content in the game, anyone who plays it will have a creepy feeling, which is similar to Tim Burton’s films. In fact, this is what Kyle, the producer, wants to express: the whole game style of sticky world is highly anthropomorphic and human centered. The author intends to show that a high level of civilization may eventually destroy our planet. Besides the game, it is more about giving a big family an association and a reflection on the modern society, calling for people’s protection of the environment Knowledge. At the end of the game, a huge telescope looks at the sky, but it can’t see through the haze, so goo flies to the sky with the telescope. Not only that, most of the plots in the game express this idea.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From 2D boy to tomorrow company, the story behind the puzzle game stick to the world/5963db6226fc41798218e4661d6b546d.jpg" alt="From 2D boy to tomorrow company, the story behind the puzzle game stick to the world"></p>
<h1 id="“Tomorrow-Corporation-Persent”"><a href="#“Tomorrow-Corporation-Persent”" class="headerlink" title="“Tomorrow Corporation Persent”"></a>“Tomorrow Corporation Persent”</h1><p>Only two members of 2D boy studio made it clear after the release of “sticky world” that they would not launch a sequel for it. After that, the studio seemed to disappear without any action. However, shortly after the game was released, the two brought Alan bugistra, the “third fan” who helped develop “sticky world”, into the studio and began to plan the development of new works. In order to cater to the theme of the new game, the company changed its name to tomorrow Corporation (tomorrow company), just like the “rusty Lake” series that I like very much. The name of the studio has also become a crucial existence in the game. At first, most people didn’t know that the studio changed its name, but until the new promotional film appeared that symbolic and cute again The strange style of painting is known.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From 2D boy to tomorrow company, the story behind the puzzle game stick to the world/c4593e3dd435498e82e01ae0c5d9c051.jpg" alt="From 2D boy to tomorrow company, the story behind the puzzle game stick to the world"><br>The new play, named little Inferno, featured two children sitting in front of a fireplace, heating themselves while burning their toys, which eventually led to a fire in the whole house. Although this trailer doesn’t attract much attention, anyone who has seen it will feel confused and no one knows what kind of game it is. When the game actually goes on the market, there is still no way to define what kind of game it is. As shown in the trailer, in a world of ice and snow, the player plays a child, purchases various toys through the purchase of a manual, burns them in his own fireplace and warms them. After burning them, he can get money. There will be additional rewards for burning out a specific combination, and then he can use them The money that arrives then buys toy, burn, make money, go on circulating like this all the time.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From 2D boy to tomorrow company, the story behind the puzzle game stick to the world/639618fecb14470291077631d1d1c95b.jpg" alt="From 2D boy to tomorrow company, the story behind the puzzle game stick to the world"><br>The same dark atmosphere, the same confusing plot, but this time the theme is more easy to understand. First, don’t let children play with fire. Second, the harm of global warming is very serious. People still need to protect the environment. After the “little purgatory” went public, the company has also redefined several principles. Let’s talk about them later. Three years later, the company brought another work called “human resource machine”, also called “programmer promotion”. The playing method of this game is even more meaningless, that is, programming. They make programming, this kind of very boring work into a very easy to start, but quite deep puzzle game. In Kyle’s design concept, everything can be made into a game, even if it’s boring. Obviously, this work has become a work suitable for the introduction of programmers in his concept.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From 2D boy to tomorrow company, the story behind the puzzle game stick to the world/9fe52a2251ae417f8a02f211444fc25d.jpg" alt="From 2D boy to tomorrow company, the story behind the puzzle game stick to the world"><br>Also three years later, tomorrow company brought the sequel “7 billion people” of “human resource machine”. The play method of this work is similar to that of the previous one, which is to add the concept of “tools” needed for programming on the basis of programming, making the puzzles in the game easier for people to lose their hair. This work, the previous work and “little purgatory” have a million sales volume after they are released, so the company has earned a lot of income. The more successful it is, the more pressure these three people feel. Because they are so “maverick”, they will never add elements in the traditional game, such as “virtual cursor” and “button” (such as game In the play, there are many designs such as “handle key guide”, which lead to the game can’t be logged in on Sony and Microsoft’s hosts. Year after year, the design inspiration will naturally be lacking.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From 2D boy to tomorrow company, the story behind the puzzle game stick to the world/d2c05f41486047cdae1014f10cc70ac5.jpg" alt="From 2D boy to tomorrow company, the story behind the puzzle game stick to the world"><br>    concluding remarks<br>As mentioned above, there are several principles for tomorrow’s company to play games. One is to ensure that each game is “unique”, the other is to control the development cost of the game, and the third is to enter the market purposefully. In short, the game should be special enough, with high completion and depth. Only in this way can excellent game works be produced. In fact, in order to make full use of the fund for game development, several people have no office from 2dboy. They usually work at home or go to the coffee shop. The fund is All for game engine, music, animation and other design, only to maintain the completion of the game. Generally speaking, these people are a little stupid and naive. They are like three old people sitting on the side of the road. They can’t see what’s on the road and don’t know what’s going on. They seem to be behind the times, but even so, they can still give up satisfactory answers.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From 2D boy to tomorrow company, the story behind the puzzle game stick to the world/ab8c1d12208e4cc99c14f864a78c7d71.jpg" alt="From 2D boy to tomorrow company, the story behind the puzzle game stick to the world"><br>Indeed, now it seems that only independent game players have such a headstrong and paranoid idea. Most people go to work that they don’t like in order to get benefits. Even if they earn money, they are not at ease. If they move forward according to their own wishes, even if they meet four obstacles at first, they will never be satisfied if they succeed. In my opinion, playing games, especially independent games, especially needs this “paranoid” view. Only enough “paranoid” can make better works. There’s no need to cater to the market and accommodate others’ tastes. If all the games are the same, what kind of “Independent Games” is it?</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>Throughout the whole field of video games, racing games have never stopped moving forward. Today, the market is full of all kinds of game works with different styles, no matter whether they are leisure or virtual, realistic or pompous. Because of its simple and intuitive playing method, racing games can lead the era in terms of picture quality, and the theme can also be accepted by any majority of people. What is puzzling is that compared with other types of games, racing games have never been too large a group of players.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From derivative to serialization, who can shake the title of Mario Kart/7440182ea2d64363962e6697905313e6.jpg" alt="From derivative to serialization, who can shake the title of Mario Kart"><br>However, there is only such a racing game, which is suitable for all ages, no matter from the playing method or the style, and it still keeps its vitality up to now. He is one of Nintendo’s leading IP, even if it is put in the whole field of racing games, it is also the largest and most popular audience. Since the SFC era, it has never lost every Nintendo game console. It is derived from the Super Mario Brothers series, and now it can be called the existence of “masterpiece”: Mario Kart.</p>
<h1 id="“he’s-really-a-go-kart”"><a href="#“he’s-really-a-go-kart”" class="headerlink" title="“he’s really a go kart”"></a>“he’s really a go kart”</h1><p>But anyone who has a certain understanding of the racing culture should know that in reality, the types of racing are very complex, and the simplest sport in all kinds is kart. The so-called karting is a micro sports car, which originated in the 1950s. Compared with F1 or other racing sports, karting can only be described as “simple” in terms of vehicle structure and driving difficulty. The speed and horsepower of the kart are not very big. The leisure kart can run 80 km / h at most, while the racing ability can only run 130 km / h, so it is much safer than other racing sports. However, due to its very low chassis, the driver can feel the relative speed 2 or 3 times faster than the speed. The easy to use, safe and equally stimulating driving experience has made this sport popular with many people who love racing but are afraid of accidents. In history, many F1 car champions are kart drivers, such as legendary car gods Michael Schumacher and Elton Senna.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From derivative to serialization, who can shake the title of Mario Kart/b589d5e8adc149fc8546c19b6721b5b9.jpg" alt="From derivative to serialization, who can shake the title of Mario Kart"><br>The go kart that Sena used to drive has been auctioned for 57500 euros (about 412000 yuan)<br>In 1990, Nintendo launched a science fiction racing game called “f-zero” as one of the first games of the new host SFC, which aims to show the hardware performance of SFC far beyond FC. The sense of speed and thrill of f-zero is rarely matched by racing games today. Due to the science fiction theme, the speed of vehicles in the game can soar to a super high speed of 400km / h. Although they can fully experience the high-speed processing function of SFC, they suffer the players who play. Super high speed means that there is a high demand for the players’ reaction ability, which makes the starting threshold of the game quite high. Many players can’t even run the whole course. In the middle of the road, because of frequent collisions, the vehicles are exploded. Compared with other racing games, the play method of f-zero is too novel, so it can’t be accepted by most players, but the quality of the game itself is still high It’s very hard.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From derivative to serialization, who can shake the title of Mario Kart/6c74b4eb4adb4c06b5c3ce75a6148a6d.jpg" alt="From derivative to serialization, who can shake the title of Mario Kart"><br>SFC version f-zero<br>Opportunity for<br>After that, Nintendo’s ace producer Miyamoto attempted to make an SFC game that could support split screen play. In order to enable the players in front of the TV to interact with each other, he still planned to make a racing game. However, in view of the split screen function to split the function of the host, he could not adopt the super high-speed design like f-zero, and in view of the kart at that time The sport was also very popular in Japan, so Miyamoto decided to use karts as the theme. But just driving doesn’t achieve the “interaction between players” effect that Miyamoto imagined. At this time, Miyamoto thought of his own series of Mario.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From derivative to serialization, who can shake the title of Mario Kart/742b5dd8acd34bcab358b23450ea6ae7.jpg" alt="From derivative to serialization, who can shake the title of Mario Kart"><br>This picture comes with BGM<br>As early as 1985, Nintendo launched the horizontal action game “Super Mario Brothers” on the FC game platform, which shocked the world for a while, caused the simple and clear play method and interesting design, made the game market which was dead because of “yadali collapse” rejuvenated, and made indelible contribution to the reconstruction of the electronic entertainment market The series of works of “Mario” has also established the name of “Mario” all over the world. Since it’s not interesting, why not add the elements of Mario to the go kart? In this way, the game itself will be very interesting, and his goal will be achieved, and with the reputation of Mario, you don’t have to worry about the publicity of the game, which can be described as killing three birds with one stone. In 1992, Super Mario Kart, a derivative of Super Mario series, came into being.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From derivative to serialization, who can shake the title of Mario Kart/c9a9497400984be79fee559e9f067548.jpg" alt="From derivative to serialization, who can shake the title of Mario Kart"><br>Super Mario Kart in split screen mode<br>Imitator<br>The highlight of “Super Mario Kart” is that the core of the game is not just to win by speed, but to “pit” each other with other drivers by using various props. People running behind can also have a high probability of rushing to the first place, and the first driver may become the target of tens of thousands of people. At the same time, the operation of the game is very simple, very easy to use, but at the same time, it does not lose the depth, even hard core players can find fun in it. This interesting racing game has been highly praised by the media all over the world as soon as it comes into the market. The supply of the game’s card belt exceeds the demand. The sales volume of 8.76 million sets also makes it the existence of the SFC platform “shoulder handle”. The success of the game also made Miyamoto realize the potential and value of this work, so he decided to take it out as an independent work and make it on the scale of other Nintendo first party games.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From derivative to serialization, who can shake the title of Mario Kart/351d881bd60045a09da9971a080c4fef.jpg" alt="From derivative to serialization, who can shake the title of Mario Kart"><br>Over the next decade, Mario Kart appeared on every Nintendo game console, both on the console and the handheld. Today, there are eight orthodox works (excluding special edition) in Mario Kart, and even many arcade versions. Each generation is constantly adding new content and new systems, and the map in the game is rarely repeated, but the only constant is the operation method that has never changed for many years, and the playing method is always the same, but each generation has different game bodies Proven. With the new system filling in, the vehicles driven by each character in the game are no longer limited to karts, so later versions of players are more accustomed to be called “Mario racing car”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From derivative to serialization, who can shake the title of Mario Kart/580a7ee487a142988e048e0022f816b1.jpg" alt="From derivative to serialization, who can shake the title of Mario Kart"><br>Like “big fight,” many of Nintendo’s other game characters have joined the game<br>There is such a common sense in the game industry: if a game can become a blockbuster, it will inevitably lead to a wave of follow-up among manufacturers. “Mario racing car” naturally triggered other manufacturers to follow suit. Sony, the next door friend, also launched its own host PS, and produced the “old confused wolf racing car” with the theme of “old confused wolf” series. Square, the Japanese manufacturer behind Sony, also launched the “land bird racing car” derived from its “Final Fantasy” series. Today, Sega has also spent many years to create a slightly mature “sonic racing” series, while the naughty dog’s “old perplexed wolf racing” is still being launched, although it can be seen that there are no less than the same elements of the “Mario racing” series, but also made its own unique features.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From derivative to serialization, who can shake the title of Mario Kart/ff95ef2df4be46cf9a3fa7387a8f1b9e.jpg" alt="From derivative to serialization, who can shake the title of Mario Kart"><br>Just released a few days ago, “the old perplexed wolf racing car: remake the plate” has also won a lot of praise from the media<br>    concluding remarks<br>No matter how the works of other manufacturers change, it is difficult to shake the dominance of Mario racing, because compared with other works, it really does it with great care. Especially in the European and American players, the Mario racing series is second only to the Nintendo Star Wars, while the proportion of Japanese and Chinese players is not too much, but not too little. After all, for European and American players, a game to be interesting is the main premise, which is why the popularity of Fortress night in Europe and the United States far exceeds that of Jedi survival. But there is no doubt that the influence of Mario racing series is really big enough, and now it can compete with his original works, and it is still growing.</p>

    <title>From disdain to participation, Nintendo has also been labeled as a mobile giant</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/From%20disdain%20to%20participation,%20Nintendo%20has%20also%20been%20labeled%20as%20a%20mobile%20giant/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Nintendo has always been the name of “playful Games”. Although Nintendo may lag behind its competitors in the development of hard technologies, Nintendo can always stand out from the rest of the world through absolute creativity and popular game design concepts, proving to the whole industry that they can become “the master of the world” only by virtue of game performance ”, after all, the premise of making a game is that it must be fun.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From disdain to participation, Nintendo has also been labeled as a mobile giant/c65cb048c5ed4db8b4494439c4c2bbb0.jpg" alt="From disdain to participation, Nintendo has also been labeled as a mobile giant"><br>In fact, Nintendo didn’t plan to do mobile games at first, even with some disdain. Now, Nintendo has launched seven mobile games, and its Baoke menggong has no decision-making power The company has launched a number of mobile games through one IP, and each of them has outstanding quality and achieved great success.<br>     clean stream<br>Since around 2012, the development technology of many kinds of mobile digital terminals has soared like a rocket, and various digital intelligent products have sprung up. The open and closed battle between various manufacturers reminds me of the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union decades ago during the cold war. It is also a crazy scramble for technology. It seems that whoever can take the lead in making progress in hard technology can get this attractive fat first. With the development of hardware technology, software can’t fall naturally. All kinds of convenient life applications in social applications are also followed closely. The chat software on the mobile phone even has the trend of replacing the version of computer platform for a time. In such an environment, mobile games are undoubtedly a potential stock, and many game manufacturers began to prepare for the land to be developed. At that time, there was a very interesting phenomenon in the game industry. Many well-known first-line manufacturers could not talk about mobile games, mobile platforms were too low, and could not reflect their hard technology and game concept, but in fact, they could not But already secretly behind the plan.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From disdain to participation, Nintendo has also been labeled as a mobile giant/f9c20980392748929a82fd6613797331.jpg" alt="From disdain to participation, Nintendo has also been labeled as a mobile giant"><br>It is obvious to all that mobile games have the ability to attract money. In view of its huge popularity and extremely fast, portable and networking features, it even gives people the feeling that “it’s a mobile game that makes money”. No matter the large and small manufacturers’ studios all rush in, the whole mobile game market can be described as “a mixture of fish and Dragons”. The most untouched company among many manufacturers is Nintendo of Japan. In the eyes of many players, Nintendo once thought that it could not follow the trend of the times, or was willing to become a stream among many followers. Nintendo’s indifference has aroused various guesses of the players, and various public opinions have begun to take rhythm in the society. However, in fact, it’s all because of the decision-making of a man named Iwata Cong, the president of Nintendo at that time. In his opinion, it doesn’t mean that the company can’t do mobile games. They want to do it at any time, just because Nintendo has always been soft Hardware combined business strategy is one of the core concepts, they will not easily try an unknown field that has never been touched.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From disdain to participation, Nintendo has also been labeled as a mobile giant/867e7820d04445f7aac27c2d0df69c83.jpg" alt="From disdain to participation, Nintendo has also been labeled as a mobile giant"></p>
<p>#I would rather die than follow<br>The price of buyout game works on the mobile platform is usually not high. Most of the products with strong ability to attract money adopt the operation mode of free download of props and charges. Naturally, Nintendo, which has been pursuing the strategy of high-quality products all its life, will not sacrifice its game nature and only make profits through internal purchase. If they do so, it will undoubtedly bring the image of “industry conscience” of Nintendo On the other hand, players of Nintendo games should know that Nintendo’s physical games have always been known as “financial products”, with high price and maintenance rate. In 2017, the first price of “Legend of Zelda: interest in the wilderness” was US $59.99, which is the price of Nintendo’s games all the time, which is about 400 yuan, but in fact, Nintendo’s physical games are famous for their “financial products” The price list of the physical version is the lowest in the sales channels of the domestic network, and it has to start from 500 yuan. Today, more than two years later, the price of the physical version of the game is still floating between 350 and 400, and it can still be equal to many of the first tier 3A productions. No matter in the view of Nintendo or the players, the game is really worth the price. If it is a cheap hand game, it certainly can’t reflect the value of the game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From disdain to participation, Nintendo has also been labeled as a mobile giant/4f9e4e08c25344ea8aecd178b10daedc.jpg" alt="From disdain to participation, Nintendo has also been labeled as a mobile giant"><br>Legend of Zelda: the rest of the wilderness<br>Under the strict control of Iwata Cong, Nintendo didn’t plan to make a mobile game for itself. No matter how much money others drew, they didn’t move. Even some media directly publicized it as a “mobile game resister”. This situation lasted for a few years. In 2015, Iwata Cong died of illness. People will always remember his contribution to the game industry, but ironically, more than a month later, Nintendo’s baokemeng company launched the mobile game “baokemeng Xiaole”. Although Nintendo has no direct jurisdiction over baokemeng, this operation is a bit confusing, as if they have been overstocked for a long time. Since Iwata Cong is no longer there, there are no restrictions on mobile games. The top management of the company will surely see the profitability of mobile games. Now they can do it, but somehow they are Nintendo. Even mobile games need to implement their production concept.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From disdain to participation, Nintendo has also been labeled as a mobile giant/07cf741d309e47f18af50a1645d3bab9.jpg" alt="From disdain to participation, Nintendo has also been labeled as a mobile giant"><br>Baoke dream, Xiaoxiao music<br>     try<br>In March 2016, Nintendo’s first game “miitomo” was launched, and “MII” is a virtual image customization service launched by Nintendo on the Wii platform. These virtual characters can be added to other works as official characters, and this mobile game is also a good restore of this. But it’s not so much a mobile game as a social software. Its playability and content are relatively scarce. Even though many players have gained in the initial stage, they have no choice but to be too sticky. Similar Games will be out of the game in less than two years.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From disdain to participation, Nintendo has also been labeled as a mobile giant/6cd6185fa527403f8e786e43604ea45a.jpg" alt="From disdain to participation, Nintendo has also been labeled as a mobile giant"><br>《Miitomo》<br>But the products that really let Nintendo open up a world in the field of mobile games are not made by itself, but also the fairies’ fairies’ fairies’ fairies’ fairies’ fairies’ fairies’ fairies’ fairies’ fairies’ fairies’ fairies’ dream go launched by baokemeng company. I believe that even those who don’t play the series of fairies’ dream have heard a little about it. Because Nintendo participated in the development of the game, this The credit has to come from Nintendo.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From disdain to participation, Nintendo has also been labeled as a mobile giant/5787dd5dd9f746cba71854d95f8f81c6.jpg" alt="From disdain to participation, Nintendo has also been labeled as a mobile giant"><br>“Fairies can dream of go”<br>Later, Nintendo offered its own top brand “Mario” and developed Super Mario Parkour for it. Although the download volume of this seat at the beginning of the launch was ten times as much as that of “baokemeng go”, the wind rating of the game was not ideal. In the eyes of many old players, this is a very different Mario game from Mario’s. He doesn’t have the consistent sophisticated level design of Mario, and compared with similar products, his difficulty is not low. At the same time, he also adopts the buyout charging mode, which not only offends series fans, but also fails to meet the needs of mobile players. For such an influential game IP, this No doubt it was a failure.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From disdain to participation, Nintendo has also been labeled as a mobile giant/e1c8eea702664e3486814b37505fac2f.jpg" alt="From disdain to participation, Nintendo has also been labeled as a mobile giant"><br>Super Mario Parkour<br>After a period of exploration, Nintendo has gradually understood the operation mode of most popular products on the market. Most of them are RPG plus pumping cards, so Nintendo has launched the same as the social game company Dena, which is also the flame seal of the same heavyweight IP: hero, and then launched the original IP with the famous Japanese hand travel company Cygames. Thanks to the participation and help of experienced people in the industry, the two works have achieved ideal reputation and profits. It is this opportunity that makes Nintendo loosen its IP for the first time. Anyway, Nintendo’s experience in the operation and development of mobile games is almost zero. If the follow-up products can be helped by other companies, it will undoubtedly guarantee the quality.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From disdain to participation, Nintendo has also been labeled as a mobile giant/fe35686e628e49c5b6262ccbe6418902.jpg" alt="From disdain to participation, Nintendo has also been labeled as a mobile giant"><br>Flame heraldry: Heroes</p>
<p>#Conclusion: it’s a long way to go<br>So far, Nintendo has launched a total of seven games. In addition to the four above-mentioned games (not included in baokemongo), there are also two derivative works, Mario Kart: tour and Mario doctor: the world, derived from the series of “animal’s son”, which are not officially launched I don’t know how the line works, but at least Nintendo has learned a lot from the production of each game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From disdain to participation, Nintendo has also been labeled as a mobile giant/ea37096d618c4f428409ec835edcea57.jpg" alt="From disdain to participation, Nintendo has also been labeled as a mobile giant"><br>This backward company still has a long way to go in this unfamiliar field, but in view of its reputation and the influence of its IP, it is no exaggeration to call it “mobile game factory”. What’s more regrettable is that Cong Ge, who insisted on not doing mobile games before his death, did not know how he would feel when he saw Nintendo’s style.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>I have such a hobby. I usually enjoy listening to European and American music in the 1930s and 1940s, and enjoy all kinds of art works with that period as the background. Even the design style of those classic cars will be studied for a long time. If these products from that period are described by the most appropriate two words, they are “elegant” and “extremely elegant”.<br>“Godfather” trilogy and “the Great Gatsby” are the films and TV works that the author has never tired of seeing. He fantasizes that if he can have the opportunity to experience the local conditions and customs of that era, it is not very realistic to think of going back through them. Therefore, video games have become the best carrier to realize this dream.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From the memories of the past gathered around the world to Mafia with only feelings left behind/df0c863bb5df4a2ab067bbffbc006bd3.jpg" alt="From the memories of the past gathered around the world to Mafia with only feelings left behind"><br>Little plum’s smile is too classic<br>In the short history of less than 300 years in the United States, there are three periods that writers and artists are most interested in, namely the civil war, the Vietnam War and the urban gangs in the 1930s. There are many works of literature and film and television about gangs, but the games developed with gangs in the 1930s are not common. In this way, a work called “the greatest open world game” was born. Even the GTA series could not reach its height, but after the passage of time, it gradually declined from the glory of that year It’s the classic series Mafia.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From the memories of the past gathered around the world to Mafia with only feelings left behind/6608d85169b446fe923173ffcd1192e3.jpg" alt="From the memories of the past gathered around the world to Mafia with only feelings left behind"></p>
<h1 id="“lost-paradise”"><a href="#“lost-paradise”" class="headerlink" title="“lost paradise”"></a>“lost paradise”</h1><p>Mafia is also known as “brothers of the four seas” and “Mafia” in China. The first generation of the series “brothers of the four seas: Lost Paradise” was born in 2002. It was produced by illusion software, a developer from the Czech Republic. Don’t get me wrong. This illusion is not the same as that illusion in Japan. Don’t say that “brothers of the four seas” was developed by that adult game company. The story background of the game took place in the 1930s during the Great Depression of the American economy. As a result of the promulgation of the prohibition of alcohol, a large number of black market private alcohol transactions were born. The gangs in charge of these black markets can be said to have mastered one of the “lifeblood” of the citizens and become more lawless.<br>Generally, according to this routine, we should play a policeman in the game to fight crime or an undercover to infiltrate the enemy. However, in fact, the protagonist of the game is a low-level member of the gang. In order to make a living, we should join the gang and experience the hardship of living outside the law from his perspective.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From the memories of the past gathered around the world to Mafia with only feelings left behind/a94c5c7b877c4732984e50f1138f1a0c.jpg" alt="From the memories of the past gathered around the world to Mafia with only feelings left behind"><br>The map of the game is a combination of Chicago, New York and Philadelphia, which are easy to associate with gangsters. It makes up an American city called “lost paradise”, which is also the subtitle of the game. I believe that in the era when the game was released, every player who first came to the city would be shocked by the city’s grandeur and surprise.<br>“Brothers of the four seas” uses the technology of that era to reproduce the United States in the 1930s to the greatest extent. It not only has a real transportation system (speeding will be wanted), but also has a real 1930s style of architecture, vehicle and clothing style. Turning on the radio in the vehicle, it also plays jazz and old-fashioned love songs in a nostalgic style. Players can not only drive their own cars, but also take various means of transportation to explore the city. Many indoor scenes can also be explored. In terms of the degree of detail polishing, even the GTA3 a year ago is inferior.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From the memories of the past gathered around the world to Mafia with only feelings left behind/eba3ce960f3c437993167feeea64d24b.jpg" alt="From the memories of the past gathered around the world to Mafia with only feelings left behind"><br>Unlike other foggy open worlds, the environment of “lost paradise” is very clean<br>In the game, we can see the bridge section of homage movie Godfather everywhere. Thanks to a classic reference object, the plot design of the game is also unambiguous. Because the plot is very excellent, the specific content will not be described here to prevent the plot penetration. It is worth mentioning that the book was also released by China Xintiandi interactive multimedia agency in China, only a month late than overseas. Although the quality of the game is very good, due to the low popularity, the work did not get much attention after it went on the market. The sales volume of PS2, Xbox and PC together just exceeded 1 million sets.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From the memories of the past gathered around the world to Mafia with only feelings left behind/0bcb87024b1241f4a5a01ba1cd6269ed.jpg" alt="From the memories of the past gathered around the world to Mafia with only feelings left behind"><br>At that time, TPS games all liked to use this “over back perspective”</p>
<h1 id="“welcome-to-Empire-bay”"><a href="#“welcome-to-Empire-bay”" class="headerlink" title="“welcome to Empire bay”"></a>“welcome to Empire bay”</h1><p>Because of too much investment but no corresponding return, illusion software was acquired by 2K, a publisher who looked at its strength. After the reorganization, the studio was called 2K Czech. At first, they made a comprehensive transformation of ls3d engine, which was used in the first generation of brothers of the four seas. They kept the characteristics of ls3d and greatly enhanced the engine performance and image performance, only preparing for their next game. At this time, the time has come to the next generation, and all they have prepared is in advance Seek. After four years of development, this new work “Four Seas brothers 2” (more known as Mafia 2 in China), which uses the “illusion” engine polished for many years, has entered the sub era host.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From the memories of the past gathered around the world to Mafia with only feelings left behind/6b42a7f2a9f14ec79e85e61701b9728d.jpg" alt="From the memories of the past gathered around the world to Mafia with only feelings left behind"><br>Thanks to the powerful engine, “Four Seas brothers 2” monologue screen in 2010 in a number of 3A big works, even now it is not out of date. Instead of continuing the story of the lost paradise, the novel recreates a new city called Empire Bay, based on New York and San Francisco.<br>The game still keeps rich details. The whole city is as fresh as it is carved out. But the most regrettable thing is that the promotion mode of the game is not like the general open world game, which is to find tasks to do in the free mode, but the whole article has guidance to guide you where to go next and what to do, but as for when to go, it is up to the players themselves It was decided that players would call this model “linear open world”, because in addition to the main task, there are very few things that players can do, which greatly reduces the playability. It is precisely because of this slightly outdated design that the score of the game slightly drops.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From the memories of the past gathered around the world to Mafia with only feelings left behind/c0dd196ebd9b415a87d8df91dc44bc5c.jpg" alt="From the memories of the past gathered around the world to Mafia with only feelings left behind"><br>The improvement of the picture is very obvious<br>Fortunately, in addition to the playability, the game is still excellent in all aspects. The media’s evaluation of this work is slightly inferior to that of the previous one. With the help of 2K publisher, the exposure of this work is finally improved. The sales volume of this work is not known to be much higher than that of the previous one, and Vito scalrtta, the protagonist of the game, has also left a deep impression on the players because of his vivid task design and handsome appearance This work has also been the most classic work of the series by the players, and people are fond of it.<br>Players who have been in touch with the whole series should know that the series of “Four Seas brothers” is different from the completely independent plots of each of the series of “GTA”. The plots of each generation of “Four Seas brothers” are related to each other. Although the proportion is not high, players will be surprised when they see the previous characters in the new series.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From the memories of the past gathered around the world to Mafia with only feelings left behind/98d6c421f807486a8f0764e8ad19f64a.jpg" alt="From the memories of the past gathered around the world to Mafia with only feelings left behind"><br>Explosions are rarely seen in the game. Once they appear, they will feel very amazing</p>
<h1 id="apply-formulaic-“innovation”"><a href="#apply-formulaic-“innovation”" class="headerlink" title="apply formulaic “innovation”"></a>apply formulaic “innovation”</h1><p>Six years have passed since the second generation was released. Many players once thought that the sequel of this series had become a “lifetime series”. When “Four Seas Brothers 3” was officially released and said that it would be released soon, all fans including the author were ecstatic. I don’t know if this IP has any special meaning. There are only three works in total, but they are all sold in three different generations. The new works are also due to land on the mainframe of this era. When the game was officially released, the scene could be described as a rush to buy. However, when the players bought the game home and experienced it for a while, they would probably generate the same question in their mind: am I not buying “brothers of the four seas”? What kind of game is this?<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From the memories of the past gathered around the world to Mafia with only feelings left behind/8189681f0db34d6b99cb76b1c79e1b5b.jpg" alt="From the memories of the past gathered around the world to Mafia with only feelings left behind"><br>The biggest change of the game is that the game developer changed to hangar 13 from the United States, so the overall game design is totally different from the concept of the original studio. In terms of the overall quality of the finished product, the picture can naturally reach the level of this generation, and the overall atmosphere is also very good (nostalgic elements), but the optimization of the game is very problematic, and the repetition of the task is very high, which is not good, and there are many traces of rush work. This time, the game put the story in new Bordeaux in the 1960s, which is now New Orleans. It was a period of extreme racial discrimination, and our protagonist happened to be a black man, so you can expect what kind of story can happen.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From the memories of the past gathered around the world to Mafia with only feelings left behind/781181d0e51b412c99e773a5f65b71c2.jpg" alt="From the memories of the past gathered around the world to Mafia with only feelings left behind"><br>The temperament of the game is different from what it used to be<br>The plot design of the game is quite excellent, but the highly repetitive tasks and a large number of bugs have caused a devastating impact on the players’ sense of substitution. If the previous work is like a thin skin, big pleats and many hair pouches, it’s like a steamed dead face bun with both ends of the skin connected together. Although it can be eaten, it’s better in both delicacy and taste The front work is much worse.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From the memories of the past gathered around the world to Mafia with only feelings left behind/c90cfcb095c24a4b855a86a0d7fc1711.jpg" alt="From the memories of the past gathered around the world to Mafia with only feelings left behind"><br>“Shall I tell you that I’ve learned to float on water before?”<br>    concluding remarks<br>The reputation of “brothers of the four seas” is worse than each other, but the funny thing is that the sales volume is higher than each other. The series relies on the high quality of the first two works to continuously accumulate new fans. However, it encounters Waterloo in the latest work, instantly pulling the players’ mood to the bottom. In the minds of fans, the “brothers of the four seas” series has always been like a literary and art movie. He doesn’t need too hot pictures. He just needs to tell a story that can resonate with the players. Even if he likes the retro elements, the design against his original intention will only disappoint the fans who like the series.<br>Seeing that the story of brothers of the four seas is about to enter the end of the 20th century, it is still about to come to modern times. If the follow-up works are going to continue to be told later, it is bound to have a lot less charm than only the 1930s. I hope that the follow-up works of brothers of the four seas can be a series restart, bringing the time back to the beginning of the 20th century, but then again, can there really be a sequel in one’s lifetime?</p>

    <title>From no one&#39;s understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/From%20no%20one&#39;s%20understanding%20to%20the%20attention%20of%20the%20public,%20the%20concept%20inheritance%20of%20soul%20series%20in%2025%20years/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In this year’s E3 game exhibition and Microsoft’s pre exhibition press conference, Japanese game manufacturer fromSoftware officially released their new work “Elden ring”. It is worth mentioning that the official said that this is an action game developed based on the “soul of darkness” series, with similar playing methods but different systems. But this is not the point. What attracts the players’ attention is that the plot of the game is written by the producer Miyazaki YingGAO, and the world view of the game is designed by George r r r Martin, the author of the famous fantasy novel song of ice and fire. When the “Soul series creator” and the legendary writer join hands, I don’t know how many “spiritualists” will fall into it.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From no one's understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years/ac79eef7da5149a8b3e1f9f5fd7879ec.jpg" alt="From no one&#39;s understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years"><br>Looking back at the past of from software (FS for short), it has been 25 years since the birth of their first work. In these years, they have changed from an unknown second-line manufacturer to a well-known second-line manufacturer. Although their status is not equal to that of other first-line manufacturers, there is no doubt that the “Soul Series” game they made is in the whole The status of the game field is also unshakable, and its design ideas are unique and advanced, which has become the inspiration source of many future game works.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From no one's understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years/0f58a312e1004e3199e271cd6816e9ff.jpg" alt="From no one&#39;s understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years"></p>
<p>#You don’t learn well when you are born<br>In 1994, FS launched their first game, King’s field, and landed on the PS1 console. This is a first person full 3D ARPG playing method similar to the ancient scroll series. We need to know that the early generation of ancient scroll in the same year has not reached the full 3D picture. As one of the early games of PS1, it is a cross era work. There are all kinds of weapons and magic in the game, and the attack methods are different, and you can choose to use accumulation attack according to the situation. The overall gloomy and depressive tone is also similar to the previous DRPG game. If you look at it, the game can be very attractive.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From no one's understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years/c14aabc6cff543bcb8fe1316108d9631.jpg" alt="From no one&#39;s understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years"><br>However, when it’s really played, it’s another feeling: the character’s moving speed is extremely slow, the player’s attack mode has a huge forward swing action, and with the “power slot” setting, he can’t attack at will in the battle. Not only that, the game’s scene is dark and dangerous, and there are many mechanism traps. Most of the time, players are either killed by traps or beaten to death by small monsters, even if the level of the character is far higher than that of the enemy. There are many hidden elements in the game that need to be explored by the players themselves. At the same time, the game can’t be archived at any time, so it’s necessary to find a special archive point. If one lives, it’s useless Please come back, great Xia.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From no one's understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years/ebfedfb595be40b0ad4f509258e4a610.jpg" alt="From no one&#39;s understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years"><br>The strike sense of the game is almost equal to none. You can only judge whether you hit it by the call of the enemy<br>I thought this was a game that could bring adventure and excitement. Unexpectedly, it was a game that people wanted to smash the handle after playing. Is it a game that is so difficult to play to revenge the society? FS’s answer is that all the Games in the market are too thin, lacking both difficulty and depth, and the full name follows the process. What’s the meaning of such games?</p>
<p>#Go the other way<br>In 2004, a programmer from Oracle Japan left the company and sent a letter of application to FS. This man was named Miyazaki YingGAO. He loved reading and video games since he was a child, so that he could achieve his dream in his lifetime. Although he likes reading, he has a congenital mild reading comprehension obstacle. Even a very simple story sometimes can’t be understood. When he comes across a bridge that he can’t understand, he will combine the previous content with the next content, and fill out the picture that he can’t understand by himself. It is with this strong imagination that FS decisively hired Miyazaki YingGAO, who has no experience in game development, and directly let him participate in the development of his own roof beam work Armored Core.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From no one's understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years/e6e3e9dc6f1d4cdc9d94cc03777f0163.jpg" alt="From no one&#39;s understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years"><br>Miyazaki Eita<br>Two years later, Miyazaki YingGAO was placed in the position of supervision of “armor core”. At that time, due to the lack of Sony PS3 console game lineup, a third-party manufacturer was needed to provide fresh blood. Sakai Jian, one of the producers of SCE, found FS. He was a loyal fan of “King’s secret order” series. He hoped that FS could develop an exclusive new work inheriting the characteristics of “King’s secret order”, which happened to be Miyazaki YingGAO I also like the fantasy theme and high difficulty design of the Kingdom secret order very much. The two decided to work together to create this new work.<br>In Miyazaki YingGAO’s imagination, the new work should have the freedom comparable to the American RPG, and the content should be rich enough. The map design ideas and some settings of the king’s secret order need to be preserved, and the difficulty must also be challenging, and the sense of attack must not be as bad as the previous game. Combining these elements, this is Miyazaki YingGAO’s original debut work demon’s sou LS).<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From no one's understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years/54687916fd594b59a5026d1af054d000.jpg" alt="From no one&#39;s understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years"><br>Spirit of the devil can be said to be the representative of going against the current at that time. All kinds of malicious settings create difficulties for players. Killing enemies can obtain “soul”. The “soul” can be used as currency for trading or experience for upgrading. Once the character dies, it will all fall down. Players can pick up “soul” after rebirth, but only half of the players are born after rebirth Life value, and the game world will become more dark. If you die again on the way back to pick up the soul, the soul will disappear, forming a more difficult and more difficult cycle. Such a difficult design makes SCE not optimistic about this work. If not for Sakai’s insistence, the game would not even have a chance to sell.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From no one's understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years/3730ea9c47774eee80b5980238909c1a.jpg" alt="From no one&#39;s understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years"><br>“Corner kill at first sight” is a popular plot in the game<br>Sure enough, after the game was launched in 2009, it only got a low score of 29 (full score of 40) from Japan’s famiton, and most people couldn’t play smoothly and easily. Of course, there are also some people who can be right on Miyazaki YingGAO’s radio waves. They understand from the design of the game that it is not only the role that becomes stronger in the game, but also the growth of the players themselves.<br>The purpose of death is to let players try all kinds of possibilities and cognitive new discoveries. The improvement of difficulty is not only to pile up the enemy’s blood volume, but also to let players explore their own routines and methods. The whole game design revolves around the three concepts of “exploration, challenge and achievement”. From this perspective, the content that stays on the surface will be stripped layer by layer, To understand the fun of the game.<br>The quality of the game is said by word of mouth. At first, 300000 sets were sold in Japan plus the cheap version, while 750000 sets were sold under the momentum of the media in Europe and America. An original IP suddenly reached a million sales volume, which was not expected by Sony or FS itself.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From no one's understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years/76c437da07f741caa27db17b908bddf2.jpg" alt="From no one&#39;s understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years"><br>Ironically, on the 10th anniversary of PS3, famiton named “ghost of the devil” as the best game of Japanese PS3</p>
<h1 id="“spiritual-sequel”"><a href="#“spiritual-sequel”" class="headerlink" title="“spiritual sequel”"></a>“spiritual sequel”</h1><p>No matter how profound the design idea of devil’s soul is, even if the deep meaning of the game is discovered later, the sales volume can also be recovered. In the eyes of Sony SCE, he is still a work of no entry. SCE will hide this IP. Even if FS intends to launch a sequel, it must be approved by Sony first. However, the gold will shine after all. The “B Consortium” of Wandai Nanmeng palace, which helped FS release games in Europe, noticed Sony’s indifference. They decided to cooperate with fs to help FS develop new games. In view of the small fame of devil’s soul and the recognition of the players, Miyazaki YingGAO has gained confidence and firmed his own unique design concept. He has already made plans for the development of the sequel. Since Sony won’t let it continue, we will change our name to be a new IP.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From no one's understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years/2512f01a2b414f4baf13326f906dd3db.jpg" alt="From no one&#39;s understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years"><br>The tone of FS and B consortia is not in line with each other<br>At the 2010 Tokyo video game exhibition, FS released to the outside world the spirit sequel of “devil’s soul” code named “project dark”, which was later the world-renowned “dark souls”. In the next issue, the author will talk about the follow-up development of FS “Soul Series”, including the innovation and evolution of design concepts and ideas in soul of darkness, blood source and wolf.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From no one's understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years/67def0789ecd4119918ebffe148160ce.jpg" alt="From no one&#39;s understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years"><br>From the very beginning, the Japanese game manufacturer from software (FS) was willing to make games with high difficulty. Since a man named Miyazaki YingGAO joined the company, the spirit of the devil, which was jointly developed by FS in Sony, made this “hard core” game mode known to most players, relying on the oral communication between players and the public opinion between the media, so that you can play The play is a fire. In Sony’s view, the game mode is really out of the stream, and there is no plan to develop a sequel. Sony holds the control of IP, so even if FS has the idea of developing a sequel, it must be approved by Sony. At this time, another Japanese manufacturer, Wanda namoko, took a fancy to the pie and decided to help FS launch a new work.</p>
<h1 id="“do-you-want-to-spread-fire-brother-”"><a href="#“do-you-want-to-spread-fire-brother-”" class="headerlink" title="“do you want to spread fire, brother?”"></a>“do you want to spread fire, brother?”</h1><p>For the design of his new work, Miyazaki YingGAO planned that the overall style of play of the game is not different from that of devil’s soul, because it can’t be regarded as the orthodox sequel of devil’s soul, so it can only be used as the spiritual sequel, which means that the game is totally different from the original, neither exactly the same nor too similar, and this game is Dark souls.<br>The biggest drawback of the previous work devil’s soul is that the plot and the world view are very vague, so this needs to be strengthened in black soul, and the system in the game needs to correspond with the plot setting. The world view of the game is also set by magic in the middle ages. In ancient times, the world was ruled by the ancient dragon family, and the whole world was covered with a layer of fog and never saw the sun. After that, there was the “original fire” in the world. Several kings of the world, relying on the power of the “King’s soul” formed by the “original fire”, defeated the ancient dragon and spread the “original fire” to all parts of the world, which dispelled the fog and made the world enter the “fire era”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From no one's understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years/3ee8c371d648429184d1dbe509bf719f.jpg" alt="From no one&#39;s understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years"><br>But in a long time, the power of “original fire” will be exhausted and extinguished, and a curse will appear on the human beings who can survive through “original fire”, and they will become immortal immortal. If the curse is deepened, they will lose humanity and become dead. The protagonist is one of the healthy people who abhor the undead and exile them or imprison them. If the “original fire” is completely extinguished, the world will return to the state once ruled by the ancient dragon. The burning of the fire requires soul. The “King’s soul” of the kings was the best “fuel”. The kings were either comparable to gods or have become monsters, which is not the existence that human beings can defeat. Therefore, the burden of collecting souls is handed to those who have immortal ability Dead people, that is, players are most fond of the “pass fire.”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From no one's understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years/35ec49e9f0714ddea29ffdbc617f1b45.jpg" alt="From no one&#39;s understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years"><br>As mentioned above, “the curse of the immortal is one of the changes in the game”. In the original “spirit of the devil”, the punishment after death is that the player becomes a spirit state, and the maximum life limit is reduced by half. In “black soul”, if the player dies many times, the protagonist will change from a human shape to a “corpse”. In this state, the player cannot use the online assistance system in the game. Compared with The death penalty in devil’s spirit is much looser.<br>For the first time, there are many other settings, even many common elements (archive, online, etc.) are also related to the plot in the game. The new work adopts the semi open world design. Although it sacrifices some interactive elements with the scene, it can also bring rich exploration content to the players, which is the biggest change of the game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From no one's understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years/8662f5a6b30b4a11b5e587ba1d10d024.jpg" alt="From no one&#39;s understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years"><br>In the concept of Miyazaki YingGAO, he wants to create a novel experience for the players through adventure, and the design of the open world can realize this concept higher. Thanks to the design of the semi open world, the game does not provide the route for players to explore, and the strategy sequence of each scene is not fixed, which can be freely arranged by players.<br>In the game, the players should not only face the enemies with different styles, but also be careful when exploring. Whenever they see a campfire (archive point), they will feel very comfortable. The whole world is integrated. On the level of sophistication, even many 3A masterpieces cannot be compared. In this world, the fun of exploration is other Type of game cannot be given.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From no one's understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years/f61499fc34b6402986d055eb5357e87a.jpg" alt="From no one&#39;s understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years"></p>
<h1 id="despicable-stranger"><a href="#despicable-stranger" class="headerlink" title="despicable stranger"></a>despicable stranger</h1><p>Without Sony’s restriction, the black soul was released on the whole platform, and the new work is no longer as unpopular as the devil’s spirit. Even the fami pass, who once scored 29 points for the devil’s spirit, dare not look down on this series this time. With the help of the “B Consortium”, the exposure rate of the downstream plays is guaranteed, and the sales volume is very considerable, even if the transplant level is not good PC version There are also 2 million sales.<br>So far, the Black Soul series has launched three orthodox works, each generation of Miyazaki YingGAO has new thoughts and attempts, making the three works slightly different in experience. Although the black soul 2 is most criticized by players as “some settings are not friendly”, the overall quality of the game is also very excellent. After the DLC of “black soul 3” was launched, it also represented a perfect ending of the series in the form of trilogy.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From no one's understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years/80bb5abcb4294662827ee7c0bd7061d8.jpg" alt="From no one&#39;s understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years"><br>The success of “black soul” made Sony, the former owner of FS, regret, so they found FS again, hoping that they could launch a new exclusive work on their sub era host PS4. At that time, “black soul 3” was not released in the early stage of honest PS4. Miyazaki YingGAO was very satisfied with the powerful function of PS4, so he agreed to this request. He planned to launch an ARPG game with the same hard core as “black soul” on PS4, and this game is “bloodborne”.<br>Different from the magic wind of the Middle Ages in black soul, this time Miyazaki YingGAO moved the background of the story to the Victorian period in the 19th century, and the player will play an exorcist to a city called Yanan for adventure. Just like buying ns for Zelda, many players choose to buy PS4 to experience the game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From no one's understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years/ba29e7047fcf43d590a9bf30789df21a.jpg" alt="From no one&#39;s understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years"><br>The core playing method of blood source is not much different from that of black soul. It’s also a semi open world hardline ARPG, but because it gets rid of the big framework of the middle ages, compared with black soul, which encourages players to use shields to resist attacks, blood source, which encourages players to use guns instead of shields to encourage attacks, and players can also “grab back” their blood volume through attacks in a short time when they are injured. Only these small changes are complete Changed the way the game was played.<br>Handsome fighting action with deformable weapons, coupled with easy to use guns to interrupt the enemy’s attack, if there is no physical value setting, I’m afraid it can not complete the general feeling of “ghost cry”. The simple vocabulary is difficult to show the excellence of blood source. In the minds of many players, blood source is the best work of the whole “soul” series. It has been proved that changing passive defense into active attack can greatly improve the fluency of the game, and also be more favored by the players.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From no one's understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years/a0e65b26bd4641b999973fc024eb08e9.jpg" alt="From no one&#39;s understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years"></p>
<h1 id="no-way-to-survive-no-way-to-die"><a href="#no-way-to-survive-no-way-to-die" class="headerlink" title="no way to survive, no way to die"></a>no way to survive, no way to die</h1><p>The success of “blood source” has given Miyazaki YingGAO a new way of thinking. Therefore, compared with “blood source”, more attention should be paid to the action of “only Wolf: shadow passing twice” was born. The film was released in March this year. The story is set in Japan during the Warring States period. The protagonist is a ninja who uses samurai swords and various Japanese weapons to fight with the enemy.<br>It’s enough to set the protagonist as a Samurai with a samurai sword. Some people use “Japanese black soul” to evaluate the game. In fact, it’s far from so simple: the way of thinking of the game is slightly different from the previous “soul” series. The previous “Errenzhuan” and “Circling” methods are no longer effective in this work. In this work, there is no dodge and no dodge Roll, only with the opponent holding a knife to block or see through the opponent’s attack, who can’t resist first who will die first.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From no one's understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years/e9f3a45515814f43a5c18ee803dc72f6.jpg" alt="From no one&#39;s understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years"><br>Wolf is not so much an ARPG game as an action game. The growth system of characters is relatively weak in plasticity. Only the life value and attack power can grow, but there are many skills of strengthening nature. A new “tolerance hand” which can be used to fly on the eaves and walk on the wall has been added, which is an unthinkable existence in the previous works. Combined with this system that can greatly improve the degree of freedom, although the way of playing the game has also changed, The game specially prepared a set of stealth system for the players, so that they could kill the enemies in an instant without any attention.<br>It is worth mentioning that if players accumulate a certain number of enemies, they can revive in situ once, but whether they choose to revive or not, they will deduct half of their experience and money, or even no loss. It can be said that it is the lowest death penalty under Miyazaki Ying masters. Because of the low punishment, the number of players dying due to impulse will naturally increase Now.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From no one's understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years/1e1cbb0aabab4b198847dac37fd85923.jpg" alt="From no one&#39;s understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years"><br>In general, the rhythm of the game is much faster than before, and there are more means to kill the enemy in seconds, not just simply pile up the enemy’s blood. The fighting styles are various, which can be decided by the players themselves. However, when the game encourages the players to try high-risk and high-yield fighting methods, the players should not forget that the difficulty of the game is still the same. Miyazaki YingGAO is the same Miyazaki YingGAO. The design of posture also shows the sword light between the Japanese samurai in great tension. From the details, the playing method is similar to the “soul” series, but this work is not a purely difficult action game, which contains the connotation that needs to be experienced by the players themselves.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From no one's understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years/5df23e3a15fc4f5aaedc9563fa4c7844.jpg" alt="From no one&#39;s understanding to the attention of the public, the concept inheritance of soul series in 25 years"><br>    concluding remarks<br>25 years later, the “black soul” series has been finished. Sony holds the IP control of “devil’s soul” and “blood source”. It is still unknown whether the sequel can be launched in its lifetime. Wolf is a product based on the “soul” series after radical reform. Although it is excellent, in fact, not many people dare to try.<br>During this period, the style of the game has changed, changed and changed, but the only thing that remains unchanged is the deep meaning that the game wants to express: the game is like life, it’s obviously impossible to pass the Customs for one life, who hasn’t experienced a hardship in his life, and the key is whether the experience learned after experiencing difficulties can provide help for future growth. Players often say that if the “soul” series wants to pass the customs, it must pave its own road with its own corpse. When walking on this road, you will find that strengthening is not only the protagonist in the game, but also the player sitting in front of the screen.</p>

    <title>From annual hot money to player score 3.7, success or failure of transformation of radiation shelter</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/From%20annual%20hot%20money%20to%20player%20score%203.7,%20success%20or%20failure%20of%20transformation%20of%20radiation%20shelter/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In the second half of 2015, a mobile game named “Fallout: shelter” came out, occupying the IOS app popularity ranking in a very short period of time, and its income also exceeded the overseas app store’s perennial champion “candy legend”, just like a posture of arrogance, becoming the international pop in 2015.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From annual hot money to player score 3.7, success or failure of transformation of radiation shelter/1b8061726c0e43ec97b9c9e748bf3750.jpg" alt="From annual hot money to player score 3.7, success or failure of transformation of radiation shelter"><br>As an old fan of “radiation” series, I was definitely refused when I heard that “radiation” was going to play. After all, there are too many adapted Lei’s works on the mobile platform, but I tried to download them out of curiosity. After the experience, I found that although this play is totally different from the previous “radiation”, there is no doubt that it is《 Radiation “, and as a mobile game, you don’t seem to think of any better design.</p>
<h1 id="marketing-advertising"><a href="#marketing-advertising" class="headerlink" title="marketing advertising?"></a>marketing advertising?</h1><p>As early as in 2008, when Bethesda, an American game company, launched radiation 3, they had the idea of making mobile games. In a trailer before the release of radiation 3, we can see some design concepts of radiation: shelter. Since the world’s first iPhone was launched in 2007, they have realized that the mobile phone market will definitely be a treasure land of great potential in the future, according to Todd Howard, the ace of club B. At that time, the very advanced design concept of the iPhone attracted them very much. They wanted to make a game for this small screen. In their opinion, it must be very interesting to make a game on the iPhone. For this reason, they designed two schemes, one of which we don’t know what it is, and the other is the current “shelter”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From annual hot money to player score 3.7, success or failure of transformation of radiation shelter/5cee00aacc824367ad194739c82325c4.jpg" alt="From annual hot money to player score 3.7, success or failure of transformation of radiation shelter"><br>TV Trailer picture of radiation 3<br>After “radiation 3” launched the last DLC, there have been calls for “radiation 4” among the players. Of course, the sequel of “radiation” needs a lot of time in the plan of community B. As we all know, the average period of launching a sequel for a game in B club is usually 7 years (except radiation 76). After all, before launching an IP sequel, they have to make sequels for other works of their own. In these seven years, the ancient scroll 5 is the product of this period. After finishing the work of ancient scroll 5, agency B also felt that it was time to produce a sequel for radiation, and at the same time they wanted to make the original version of the mobile game they imagined. But after all, radiation 4 was the top priority, so they had to give the game plan to the outsourcing studio for production, and at the same time they could take the name of “publicity for radiation 4” as the tour It can be said that the application of advertising fee for the play, which is used as the development budget, is a double shot.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From annual hot money to player score 3.7, success or failure of transformation of radiation shelter/e4473006b4c44f6a9a59aaed92b5d4a8.jpg" alt="From annual hot money to player score 3.7, success or failure of transformation of radiation shelter"><br>Radiation 4 is said to be “sharpening a sword in seven years”, but it doesn’t take that long<br>The development of “sanctuary” was entrusted to behaviour, an independent game studio from Montreal, Canada. Its representative was “kill at dawn”.<br>It’s surprising that behaviour originally planned to make a social mobile game after getting the design plan of B club, but unexpectedly, B club’s plan is to make a single machine, and it can’t contain the paid content that is too radical to affect the game experience, and the game doesn’t have the networking function, which can be said to be very conscientious. At the E3 game exhibition in 2015, Tao de first introduced the system and features of radiation 4 to the outside world in detail, and simply announced the existence of the sanctuary, which can be downloaded for free on the night after the conference. A few simple introductions to the play method have completely ignited the game world. Who could have thought that club B actually made a mobile game? You should know that at that time, there were not many big factories making mobile games. Besides, it seemed very interesting. That night, countless fans of radiation rushed into the app store to download the shelter, and even nearly paralyzed Apple’s server.</p>
<p>#There is no core game<br>In just 24 hours, the number of downloads of “sanctuary” on IOS only reached 2 million, 5 million in two days, and 10 million in a week. No matter the heat or income, other mobile games were directly left behind. Such a success was not expected by all members of Society B. In short, the sanctuary is a simulation business game. The background of the game is based on the postwar end design of radiation. Players play a shelter administrator in the game. They can build their own shelters at will, and take in more refugees from waste land to increase the manpower of the shelters, so as to bring productivity and long-term stable operation of the shelters Go on, just like other simulation business games, there is no clear core play method, so the play method of the game is entirely dependent on the individual.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From annual hot money to player score 3.7, success or failure of transformation of radiation shelter/0ebb8bfb65364c4a98d42facbaade94e.jpg" alt="From annual hot money to player score 3.7, success or failure of transformation of radiation shelter"><br>It’s a very fulfilling thing to watch the shelters grow<br>As a simulation business game, the operation and start-up difficulty of the game is very simple, which is very suitable for the mobile platform. Even the players who have never been exposed to the radiation series can easily start to play. After all, the atmosphere of the game is much more relaxed and pleasant than the orthodox works. The black humor and cartoon art style that radiation series always uphold can also let more people connect Touch. Logging in to the mobile platform means to find a way not to offend the old players of the series to avoid smashing the signboard. At the same time, as a marketing game, it also has the ability to attract the players who have never been exposed to the radiation series. Under these two main premises, the quality of the game can be very outstanding. Krypton gold is low in strength, well made and fun to play. Anyone can play it easily. Even after a few years, this game is still excellent.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From annual hot money to player score 3.7, success or failure of transformation of radiation shelter/28015ff063aa4930ae7e659ec8594f95.jpg" alt="From annual hot money to player score 3.7, success or failure of transformation of radiation shelter"><br>It’s OK. It’s interesting to see the daily life of these villains<br>“Sanctuary” not only didn’t disappoint the old players of “radiation” series, but also made it an appetizer when waiting for the release of “radiation 4”. For new players, the above advantages are enough to attract new players. In the game review area of various platforms, it is not hard to find that most of the groups who like this game come into contact with the original works of radiation series because they think it is interesting, and even a considerable number of people choose to buy a copy of radiation 4 after they have been in contact with mobile games. There is no doubt that this game really meets the original “interesting” assumption of Society B, and at the same time, it has also reached the goal The purpose of making this game. With the success of the game, B club began to pay attention to the game, which was originally just for advertising. During this period, it had stable content updates and various interesting festival activities, which greatly enhanced the playability of the game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From annual hot money to player score 3.7, success or failure of transformation of radiation shelter/829ddd331ce74f0aacbbcba05b178fb2.jpg" alt="From annual hot money to player score 3.7, success or failure of transformation of radiation shelter"><br>Exploration and playing method of field copy updated in later stage</p>
<h1 id="transformation-in-the-Chinese-market"><a href="#transformation-in-the-Chinese-market" class="headerlink" title="transformation in the Chinese market"></a>transformation in the Chinese market</h1><p>“Sanctuary” has been a great success in the overseas market. However, there are many fans of “radiation” in China. They are also worried about the lack of Chinese in the game. Although the amount of text is not much, it does not affect the game playing, but they cannot get the best game experience. However, only Shanda (now renamed Shengqu) is the game manufacturer who pays attention to this market. Shengqu initiated a cooperative plan for the game to B club, and finally the Chinese version of the sanctuary was represented by Shengqu. Until now, the Chinese version represented by Shengqu still has an average score of 8.5 points, which fully retains the advantages of the original version, does not add the “Chinese krypton gold” which is more pitiful, but also has a stable update as the international service, which is the biggest reason why the work can maintain a good reputation in the domestic market.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From annual hot money to player score 3.7, success or failure of transformation of radiation shelter/f00128f4e1d041769672f70c980106d6.jpg" alt="From annual hot money to player score 3.7, success or failure of transformation of radiation shelter"><br>The official website of Shengqu is no longer updated<br>With the Chinese version, players no longer have to complain that they can’t understand it. But just after the mainland version was launched for a long time, Shengqu said that it would cooperate with agency B to launch the mainland exclusive online game “sanctuary ol”. Although it responded to the demand of some players for more people, it also made many players who are content with the status quo feel a little more uneasy.<br>Sure enough, after the launch of “sanctuary ol”, the players found that although the new work has many more things than the original, such as the transition animation, fine figure vertical painting and more game content, etc., it is the same as other card swiping and swiping hand games in the core part, excluding the content of the single version and replacing it with more online games. You should know that although the operation mode of krypton gold pumping card is quite popular in China, this application mode is naturally equipped with debuff. Whether krypton gold pumping card is made conscientiously or not, it will definitely cause many disputes. Therefore, the reputation of the game has fallen. In the eyes of most players, the once excellent game has become “krypton swindle online game”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From annual hot money to player score 3.7, success or failure of transformation of radiation shelter/ab23591ff7e44433ae6b76fc735cac44.jpg" alt="From annual hot money to player score 3.7, success or failure of transformation of radiation shelter"><br>Radiation: sanctuary ol Poster<br>However, in fact, there are many problems in the game. Most of the reasons for players’ complaints are that bugs are not repaired, krypton gold has a low delivery rate, and the adjustment of game balance is too mindless. If krypton gold is not available, a lot of time is needed to brush it, and its liver degree is much longer than that of a single machine. In short, there are fatal problems in the operation of the game. From an objective point of view, as it is based on the stand-alone version of the shelter, there is no problem in the bottom of the game, and Shengqu has also added some unique designs on the basis of the original system. Unfortunately, it does not meet the wishes of the players. The evaluation of the game on taptap is only 3.7 points , and the overall average score is even lower than this score, which fully shows players’ dissatisfaction with the game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/From annual hot money to player score 3.7, success or failure of transformation of radiation shelter/7165db7683864891acd537874dd5c48c.jpg" alt="From annual hot money to player score 3.7, success or failure of transformation of radiation shelter"><br>IOS score is a little higher, but it has no egg use<br>    concluding remarks<br>Maybe for the Chinese game market, it’s common to see “sanctuary ol”, but as an old fan of “radiation”, I believe that most players who like this series will have the same feeling with the author: the bad reviews of “sanctuary ol” will definitely make the whole “radiation” series decline in domestic reputation, after all, “radiation” is still a small number in China For those who haven’t been in touch with the radiation series, radiation is the “krypton swindler” who has failed in the rating.<br>Maybe I’m worried too much, because the players who really like “radiation” series will not try this mobile game, and will never care about the views of other players. As for the failure of sanctuary ol, I can’t bear it. I hope that sanctuary ol can improve in the future. Since we have all cooperated with community B, we should learn their design rather than their operation.</p>

    <url>/2019/11/08/Hard%20core,%20interesting,%20huge%20and%20worth%20exploring/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>If we can say what the game works I am most looking forward to in the future, it must be the outer worlds produced by Obsidian studio. I am a loyal fan of Fallout Series and half a sci-fi fan. This so-called “space version of radiation” works can’t help but arouse people’s hearts 。 Although the picture and battle part of “tianwai world” look very common in the current intelligence, it is worth looking forward to at least the unique style of obsidian in network narrative task design, game mechanism and system. After all, obsidian’s game has never sold well.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Hard core, interesting, huge and worth exploring/77a6318d42974b159deb010ff52c46d6.jpg" alt="Hard core, interesting, huge and worth exploring"><br>No one can fully understand the existence of space. For people, it is always full of mystery. In the vast universe, there may be beautiful scenes that have never been seen before, or unknown crises hidden in the dark side of the planet. No matter what, it will arouse people’s curiosity and give people an impulse to explore. Obviously, the exploration of the universe can only stay in the imagination for us, and we can explore it in another form through some media. All along, the author is looking forward to a game work that can truly realize the exploration of the universe at will. Although such a game is not without it, it seems that it is always a bit strong and unsatisfactory.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Hard core, interesting, huge and worth exploring/296fae2143554f5dbe3a83876ab07c24.jpg" alt="Hard core, interesting, huge and worth exploring"></p>
<p>#The most “hard core” universe<br>Speaking of the most famous game in the game field, eve online (Star Wars Eve) is a hard science fiction Simulation online game produced by CCP game company of Iceland. It has been in operation for 16 years, with extremely stable user group and update frequency. After all, as a space theme game, there is no complex scene design, only the accuracy of the model and the light and shadow can keep a high level of screen. Eve is an online game dominated by players. Players can carry out various activities in this universe with super freedom. You can be a businessman wandering between various galaxies, or a heavy industry worker. What most people yearn for is to be a fleet commander in charge of strategizing and Defending Forces in the universe.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Hard core, interesting, huge and worth exploring/fde1257820724d108cf62d9657dc47c5.jpg" alt="Hard core, interesting, huge and worth exploring"><br>So many game content, looks very attractive, should be very popular by reason. However, in fact, the players of this game are losing even if the user group is no longer stable. The main reason is that this hard science fiction game is “too hard”. Without the guidance of the old players, the novice may not understand the operation of the game for a day. At the same time, the game is a time charging system. In the game, you need to spend a lot of time learning skills for your characters. Only when you learn the skills can you survive in this universe normally. Just like students in class, only when you learn the knowledge can you know how to do exercises.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Hard core, interesting, huge and worth exploring/b43a41b4b33648808696e9b680b7f5ff.jpg" alt="Hard core, interesting, huge and worth exploring"><br>These two very “hard core” settings lead to a very high threshold of the game. In the current fast-paced game environment, it is clear that “Eve” is no longer popular. In fact, in my opinion, if the guidance and teaching part of the game in the early stage can be simple and clear, and at the same time, a new channel can be established to let old players and new players communicate with each other, it can not only greatly reduce the threshold, but also retain the content of the game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Hard core, interesting, huge and worth exploring/b0b4b75ea8e64d94ae0b24eeb5108a18.jpg" alt="Hard core, interesting, huge and worth exploring"></p>
<p>#The most “interesting” universe<br>If you want to explore the universe, the first and most basic requirement is that you have a way to go to space. When it comes to going to space, it is essential to have a spaceship. The space simulation independent game “kerbal space program” created by squad using unity3d is a game work to simulate and build a spaceship. In the game, the player plays a worker of Kambala aviation, and needs to design and launch rockets, spaceships and orbiters by himself depending on various modules provided for the player in the game Explore the entire kerbol galaxy. In essence, this work is also a sandbox game. It has a highly customized system and certain open source. Players can install a variety of mods for the game to increase functionality. At the same time, the characters in the game are very magical. Because of them, the game is not so serious though it is quite deep.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Hard core, interesting, huge and worth exploring/3a00fca3a6b1408990016474f1ceb32d.jpg" alt="Hard core, interesting, huge and worth exploring"><br>It’s not difficult to build a spaceship. The difficulty lies in whether it can be successfully launched and work normally. In view of the highly customized system of the game, players can also create all kinds of wonderful spaceships at will. In most cases, it’s impossible to send a spaceship to the sky only by brain holes, so players need to try again and again. At first, the spaceship may land and explode when it’s launched, but the elements in the game are quite interesting, which can let players master the use of a large number of complex tools in fun, and finally let the rocket rush out of the earth after repeated failures. What players felt at that time The sense of achievement received is unparalleled.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Hard core, interesting, huge and worth exploring/885804925d1f4a01ab4214132b6b3fee.jpg" alt="Hard core, interesting, huge and worth exploring"><br>It is worth mentioning that the birth of this game came from the dream of a gamer. Before the birth of the game, the game development group squad had planned an activity called “make dream come true” for its employees, which let them recommend their own ideal game plan and make it a real game. One of the employees, Philip faranger, put forward the idea of “building a spaceship into space”. He said it was his dream from childhood. At last, the two founders of squad decided to fund the project, so they had the work. The name of “Kambala” came from the name of the tin paper man tied to the fireworks when Philip was a child.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Hard core, interesting, huge and worth exploring/783cd4b278ad44bb993310c67eba511d.jpg" alt="Hard core, interesting, huge and worth exploring"></p>
<h1 id="the-largest-universe"><a href="#the-largest-universe" class="headerlink" title="the largest universe"></a>the largest universe</h1><p>Question: which game map is the biggest in the current game field? It is estimated that a considerable number of people will say “my world”. At first, due to the random generation of its map, many people thought that the map of the game was an infinite map continuously generated outwards. This turned out to be a rumor later. According to the official, if a square is one meter, the map of my world can reach the size of 60 million times 60 million square meters without the limitation of hard disk memory, and the end is the invisible bedrock. In this way, the map area of “my world” can reach the size of 7000 earth, which is a very exaggerated figure. And there is an excellent map bigger than my world, which is the famous space sandbox adventure game “no one in deep space”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Hard core, interesting, huge and worth exploring/feb9d01f87224d4391388e2c377f9ab9.jpg" alt="Hard core, interesting, huge and worth exploring"><br>Although “no one in deep space” was once called as consumer fraud by players when it was launched, few of the openings boasted at the E3 conference were actually realized, but for the first time, it is true that at least 184.4 billion (yes, two billion) planets are officially promised for players to explore, because these planets are all randomly generated by the system It will take 585 billion years for players to explore every planet for a second. This number is not something players can accomplish in a lifetime. For a space game, it’s like a dream to have so many stars to explore at will.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Hard core, interesting, huge and worth exploring/a69b910691cf404db0d45f7f3f4e2919.jpg" alt="Hard core, interesting, huge and worth exploring"><br>After more than two years of supplement and update, the players gradually accepted the game from the beginning of “everyone shouting and fighting”. The developer, hallo games, is trying to fulfill the promise he made to the players little by little, and is constantly adding new content to the game. The game has gradually entered the right path. If “no one in deep space” two years ago was an unshaped and ugly original stone, after two years of continuous polishing and polishing, the current version of it has become a shining gem. Although it still fails to reach the rich universe when E3 was displayed in that year, the comprehensive optimization of the content and the real decoration of multi person mode brought by the update make it an excellent work worth experiencing for a long time.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Hard core, interesting, huge and worth exploring/37ba2ac43b0f4512be71e1e7b0bccb14.jpg" alt="Hard core, interesting, huge and worth exploring"><br>    concluding remarks<br>People are always curious about the unknown. Although there are endless treasures in the sea to be explored, the size of the sea is still limited, and will be exhausted one day. No one knows where the end of the universe is, and no one knows how big the universe is, and how many stars there are in the sky. This mystery may be forever We can’t get the answer, but it’s a good thing to feel the mystery and greatness of the universe in a safer way.</p>

    <title>How can Forza become the best racing game</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/How%20can%20Forza%20become%20the%20best%20racing%20game/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In today’s racing game field, although there are still not many active works, it must be the “big guy” with extraordinary strength who can go to the present, and these most important roles are the representatives of “racing game” in the minds of many players. If we put aside the more independent rally car, now only “GT car” and “extreme speed” are the two oligarchs with the greatest influence. In the eyes of many people, these two are like two rivals who have been dead for many years. They have to fight for each other’s lives. However, they have different characteristics in two completely different ways.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How can Forza become the best racing game/7c856f675e164b1c89c43b36460e2eb7.jpg" alt="How can Forza become the best racing game"><br>Some people say that GT racing advocates enjoying automobile culture, remembering the past and looking forward to the future, while extreme racing advocates growth and progress, and dares to challenge oneself to obtain honor. As for who to choose depends on their interests and orientation, rather than choosing the most interesting game from an objective perspective, the author will give this title to extreme racing at once, accurately It is the horizon series derived from extreme speed.<br>The first card of<br>The first generation of GT racing was born in 1997. Although the picture performance is limited by the weak function of PS, it is the first time for players to experience the pseudo real driving experience in the virtual world. At the same time, the game contains a variety of famous cars and luxury cars, even many models that are difficult to see at ordinary times, which can allow players to drive freely. It is called the Enlightenment of pseudo real racing Product. The appearance of “GT racing car” means that the benchmark of racing games has been raised to a higher level, and it has become a big exclusive number one of Sony’s PS hosts. If you want to play racing games on PS hosts, then “GT racing car” will be the first choice.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How can Forza become the best racing game/7132431e7f5249538001c56920685a92.jpg" alt="How can Forza become the best racing game"><br>GT racing<br>Around 2000, due to the almost monopoly of the European and American market by the domestic mainframe launched by various Japanese manufacturers, the digital big V Microsoft in Europe and America came out and wanted to enter the mainframe industry to break this situation. In 2001, the first generation of Microsoft’s Xbox came into the market. Because the hardware architecture basically adopts PC configuration, and the price is much cheaper than the same configuration of PC, the sales volume of Xbox in the U.S. region is quite considerable, and there are many works on hand that can support the scene in the first launch. Since we are an American mainframe, how can we not have “gun car ball”? “Ball” has “live football”, “FIFA” series supporting scenes, “gun” has a new IP “halo” as the exclusive 3a, but only in “car” there is a vacancy, Microsoft in order to make up for this field, so in the same year let their own game department set up turn 10 studios, to develop the first exclusive racing game for Xbox host, first let other studios produce “Microsoft pull” “Challenge” and “world street car” are in the limelight, while the goal is to surpass Sony’s “GT car”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How can Forza become the best racing game/b9d09229796a4412ad996467be30f6b7.jpg" alt="How can Forza become the best racing game"><br>World Street Racing<br>The rise of<br>In 2005, the semi pseudo real racing game “Forza Motosport” (extreme racing), which is the main professional event, came out. Although the quality is excellent and the screen performance is excellent, and the special optimization for Xbox host is also very good, but for a young tiger, the big brother “GT racing” is not defeated in a short time. In addition, Xbox is on sale It’s far less than PS2 in quantity. The famous “extreme race” is dead under the shadow of “GT”. Microsoft could not give up like this. Bill Gates decided to put in a coin to play again, and then he was ready to launch the next generation of mainframe before Sony. Soon after that, he launched the second generation of mainframe Xbox 360, and the sequel of “extreme race” was put on the agenda.<br>In 2007, “extreme race 2” was released, but it still failed to beat the following “GT racing 5” in terms of sales volume and popularity. The second crusade of turn 10 failed again. However, as the saying goes, turn 10 also has great ambition. If they want to beat “GT racing”, they decided to work hard again to correct the shortcomings in the two generations of works, and constantly enrich the game content of the sequel Learn from other successful works.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How can Forza become the best racing game/b36f1222316e48fb9907f817aaace366.jpg" alt="How can Forza become the best racing game"><br>Extreme speed 2<br>Finally, in 2009, “extreme speed 3” by jidacheng, relying on its own excellent quality and the general development progress of “GT” series, finally has the sign that it can surpass “GT”. It can be said that each generation of the “extreme speed” series is constantly updating and iterating at the rate of one production every two years. On the other hand, almost every generation of the “GT” works are redeveloped in a new way, which makes the development progress of the game more efficient with less effort, and the time consumed is not directly proportional to the quality of the game. In addition, some innovation content is also available For the first time, GT series shows signs of retrogression. It seems that updating and iteration has always been the tradition of American game development for many years, and this development method is especially effective when used in sports games. The picture of extreme speed is getting better and better, the vehicles are more and more, the playing methods are more and more abundant, and the number of works is still the same as GT. This young man with a green face in those years also gradually catches up with it by accumulating “practical experience” He has become a well-known existence in the field of racing games.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How can Forza become the best racing game/75e59081ad6f4d47a19694ac1bc7f0d4.jpg" alt="How can Forza become the best racing game"><br>Extreme speed 3</p>
<h1 id="horizon"><a href="#horizon" class="headerlink" title="horizon"></a>horizon</h1><p>Since it’s about racing games, we have to mention another senior with more profound qualifications, the best flying car. This series of past glories need not be introduced too much by the author. However, since 2008, the series has gradually gone downhill. There is a rather interesting setting and a beautiful open world in wujianfengyun, and we try to take the professional pseudo real style The “speed change” can’t satisfy the old fans of the series. The “heat trace” which returns to the pursuit of the police and bandits is still hard to reach the once prosperous level although its reputation has picked up. For a kind of entertainment oriented racing game, it seems that they are a little talented.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How can Forza become the best racing game/253e8d53bf354fbc8e87ab93855543af.jpg" alt="How can Forza become the best racing game"><br>Top speed: changing speed<br>Microsoft thought it was an opportunity, so in 2010, it set up a new studio called playground 18 (because there are 18 people). It plans to launch a derivative work for the extreme speed series, which combines the high freedom open world with the vehicle data of the extreme speed series. It can be said that it has both entertainment and depth. This studio integrates senior members from all over the world who have participated in the development of various kinds of racing games. They know how to please the players in the racing games, so they start the development of this new work while expanding the team size, and this game is the later famous “extreme racing: Horizon”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How can Forza become the best racing game/0157cc4c83ac4a6d82ec994cbdc0353e.jpg" alt="How can Forza become the best racing game"><br>Extreme speed: the horizon<br>Horizon is a carnival for racing enthusiasts in the game. There are beautiful scenery and exciting competitions here. Winning or losing is not the key to the party, but to enjoy the pleasure of free driving and the sense of self-development. Driving your favorite car on the beautiful road will give you a comfortable and pleasant look It’s like pouring some black pepper juice on the steak to make the taste richer. Horizon Series is also updated at the rate of one in two years, so it’s going to be sold separately from ultimate race, keeping players fresh all the time, while horizon 3 in 2016 makes the series reach a peak level, which is regarded as the best racing game by players; and horizon 4, which is released in 2018, is newly added with “micro innovation” ”The alternation of seasons has subverted the players’ cognition again. Now, anyone who mentions the racing game will strongly recommend Horizon Series.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How can Forza become the best racing game/8d396e43602748e8a9553ad1bf8e7945.jpg" alt="How can Forza become the best racing game"><br>Extreme speed: Horizon 4<br>    concluding remarks<br>The success of the extreme speed series largely depends on the stable update frequency and the continuous improvement of the game quality. He has been polishing the series for more than ten years, and has made a very good balance between simulation and entertainment. Although there is a lack of depth compared with other simulation racing games, the comprehensive quality has been discussed It is the existence of arrogance. Although GT sport, the latest series of GT, suffered from Waterloo at the beginning, it is also slowly recovering its lost reputation through updating. Today’s volume is already different. As for the players, perhaps the only thing the racing game needs is a “cool” is enough. The temperament of GT is elegant, but not everyone can enjoy it. As the author said at the beginning, just from the perspective of the game, extreme racing is undoubtedly the best.</p>

    <title>How warframe became the best free game on the earth&#39;s surface</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/How%20warframe%20became%20the%20best%20free%20game%20on%20the%20earth&#39;s%20surface/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I vaguely remember that it was an afternoon many years ago. I invited several friends to play games in the Internet bar when I had nothing to do. When I opened the colorful game menu, I made a mistake for “what to play”. On the way to the bar to buy drinks, I happened to see a passer-by playing an action game, which looks like an action shooting game, but the characters in the game can use guns and knives. In a very sci-fi scene, they can walk freely while fighting with the enemy, which looks cool. Just as I was wondering what kind of game it was, I noticed that this friend used the windowed mode to play the game. There were four small words on the window: “star wars a”, so I went back to my seat to find this game. After that, I fell in love with this game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How warframe became the best free game on the earth's surface/fa1f6b9d64c440e0909dfbc4d63a7baf.jpg" alt="How warframe became the best free game on the earth&#39;s surface"><br>The author is half a science fiction fan and half a special shooting fan. Obviously, this game is very appetizing to the author. Although the art style of the game looks strange, I still feel pretty good after I get used to it. I learned warframe from Star Wars A. from national service to PS4 console service, I finally came to PC international service. Although I didn’t witness the birth of this game, I also witnessed the growth and transformation of the game in a period of time. Although the game is relatively small among the domestic players, it is popular in the global market because of its excellent quality, and the number of online players has always been at the top of the list. The reason why this game is so popular is its super high quality, but it’s amazing that such a high-quality game is an online game, but a free game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How warframe became the best free game on the earth's surface/b2c4b3c5dc2940c692503ca0c51b686f.jpg" alt="How warframe became the best free game on the earth&#39;s surface"></p>
<p>#God’s family<br>In 1993, a mini game called “Legends of murder” appeared in a disc magazine called “big blue disk”, which earned young James schmals the first bucket of gold in his life, a full $1200. James is a Canadian who has been interested in game making since high school. The success of the game made him realize that he may be able to make full-time games to make profits. Although he studied mechanical engineering in school, James chose to become a professional game developer. James got to know some game developers through many game works. Through them, he got to know a community dedicated to game developers. There, James got to know Mark Ryan, the co-founder of epic company. With his help, the second game of James, solar winds, was released by epic company.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How warframe became the best free game on the earth's surface/03e6d43de53e4aaea824d0a47bcef388.jpg" alt="How warframe became the best free game on the earth&#39;s surface"><br>Picture of big blue disk on DOS platform<br>From selling $1200 for a game to making $1200 a month for a game, James is more determined. If he can make another game, his monthly income will double. Since the electronic Pinball was a very popular entertainment project at that time, James’ next game was a pinball game, which was named epic pinball in the name of epic.<br>The quality of this game is even higher than James’ own imagination. He just did it and made it. In his opinion, maybe the value of this game is not only $1200, but also 3000 or even 4000, so that he can live a life of extreme luxury. However, the fact was beyond James’ expectation. After the game was released, epic sent James a check of 50000 dollars, which made James enter a new world in a flash, which made him realize that there is a future in the future of playing games, so he used the money to establish digital extremes (DE) studio.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How warframe became the best free game on the earth's surface/c81f4fb30955474fb61eba0078db3054.jpg" alt="How warframe became the best free game on the earth&#39;s surface"><br>Epic pinball game screen</p>
<p>#Ambition<br>After the studio was established, epic hoped that de would continue to launch a sequel to epic pinball, so James recruited some people to take charge of the development of the game, while he ran to study the design of 3D games. When it comes to epic, its most famous work in that year was the series of “the unreal arena”. Many of its works were developed with the participation of de. In view of De’s help to James before, the two companies have started a long-term cooperation relationship. James’s main work is to design weapons and combat mechanism for this 3dfps game. Many weapons in the game have two shooting modes. Because of the addition of this system, the combat mode and operation skills of the game have a different style than usual, making the game playable This system is James’ proudest achievement.<br>De and epic jointly launched several unreal arena, and the specifications and capacity of each generation are constantly expanding. Therefore, the two companies even considered merger for a time, but considering that the super scale of the merger will lead to the increase of tax payment, which will be a large expenditure, so the two companies interrupted the cooperation relationship, just like graduating students Things.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How warframe became the best free game on the earth's surface/2466d2ab126e4e828254b571fd8bf94b.jpg" alt="How warframe became the best free game on the earth&#39;s surface"><br>Unreal arena game screen<br>Don’t know where the inspiration of de after solo flight comes from. They plan to make a game with different styles. In their imagination, this is a 3A game and a sci-fi style MMO online game. In short, they have ambition, but it is difficult to achieve it with their existing conditions. The most fundamental reason is that money is simple and direct. The studio staff created a demo for the dark sector project, and tried to show their ideas to other publishers through the demo, so as to get their approval and fund the project. After several attempts, most developers don’t value the idea of this demo, but the developers behind this demo may be good talents, who can be hired to continue their other games.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How warframe became the best free game on the earth's surface/12d2b26475154014937d6bad0ce32545.jpg" alt="How warframe became the best free game on the earth&#39;s surface"><br>Dark zone demo screen</p>
<p>#It’s hard to start<br>This is a very painful blow to de. their hard work has not been recognized. However, out of the concern for their employees, they have to take this job and become a third-party developer, so that the company can have a stable income. After all, there are so many people waiting to eat in the company, and the company’s surplus grain is really not much. The employees who come to De to work Most of them have their own difficulties, so it’s impossible for De to dismiss them easily. Besides, dismissal also needs to prepare severance pay for them, so they need this job to support the company’s livelihood. This publisher is no one else. It is 2K, a well-known publisher who was just in its infancy. After that, de participated in the development of 2K’s many games, such as pariah, its sequel warpath, and the host version transplantation of 2K’s many well-known works.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How warframe became the best free game on the earth's surface/0b985332086c41b18e5b5e208846ba88.jpg" alt="How warframe became the best free game on the earth&#39;s surface"><br>The transplanting of PS3 version of “biochemist” is in the charge of de<br>As for the “dark zone”, de has always been obsessed with it. While completing the work of publishers, de continues to find ways to sell the idea of this plan. This game combines the efforts and genius of several core members of the studio, but at that time, there seemed to be a consensus in the industry that all games related to science fiction themes would not be popular. Obviously, de hit the muzzle of the gun this time. In order to sell the idea as soon as possible, de had to make a compromise, remove the science fiction settings in the game, and turn into an action shooting game with a style more like the combination of alloy equipment and biochemical crisis. The mode also changed from online game to stand-alone game. As we all know, Canadians are naturally humble, and they can really bear the pain. Although the style of the game runs counter to what they think, they finally sell their ideas, and some people are willing to pay for the game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How warframe became the best free game on the earth's surface/0485f83063134d5f9e5fe4a72d7333c2.jpg" alt="How warframe became the best free game on the earth&#39;s surface"><br>Are you familiar with your eyes?<br>The time has come to 2008. The game called “black zone” has been sold successfully, and it has won the medium-sized sales and reputation in the industry. It’s not hot but it’s still worth watching. In the eyes of De, although the name is the same as the original “dark zone”, it is absolutely different from the original “dark zone”. As a result, De is not willing to end like this. They are still looking forward to one day being able to make the game they originally envisioned, and fully retain their proper posture. Their ambitions have become more ambitious and crazy than they were at first, but what they didn’t expect is that in the end, they have achieved as much as James’ epic Pinball sold 50000 dollars.<br>It seems that they are particularly fond of the word “darkness”. After the creation of “Dark Sector”, digital extremes successively participated in the production of two FPS games of “biochemist 2” and “national defense”, and led the development of 2K’s series of works “darkness 2”, which aims to have a relatively stable income In order to maintain the operation of the studio.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How warframe became the best free game on the earth's surface/2e535500807848e1b0465d196cfdac7a.jpg" alt="How warframe became the best free game on the earth&#39;s surface"><br>Dark 2 game screen<br>However, with the development of time, the development cost of the game is also increasing year by year, and De is not a studio for developing 3A games, so the medium-sized games such as those produced by de are no longer favored by publishers. De wants to develop 3A large-scale games, but it is helpless that the resources at hand are insufficient, but the development of medium-sized games is not necessarily successful. At this time, de has entered a forward and backward stage A dilemma.</p>
<p>#How about a free game?<br>In 2010, a new type of game mode “military games” appeared on the market. The first representative work is the military online game “world of tank” developed by wargaming from Belarus. As a free online game, although it is small in size, it has full playability, and has a good balance between simulation and leisure, so it has achieved quite good results when it was launched. The success of “tank world” attracted the attention of de. at the beginning, they realized that “why can’t we make some small-scale game works with creativity if we have to try to make big or medium-sized games?”? With such a concept, James schmals, the founder of De, and Steve Sinclair, the studio design director, began to investigate the game market, and studied the small but excellent free online games in the market. They realized that their games can also be like these games, and follow-up the game through revenue New, so it can form a good cycle.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How warframe became the best free game on the earth's surface/5a8a20637c7a452883be2b111470a9c1.jpg" alt="How warframe became the best free game on the earth&#39;s surface"><br>Tank world<br>De picks up the design prototype of their ideal “dark zone” again. They hope to show their ideal posture in this new work. This will be a “science fiction + Ninja” style action game. The playing principle is that players can rob the enemy’s space station or spaceship like the star pirates, and the core system is similar to the “land without owner” Shot plus RPG, although it’s a brush game, but it’s more action oriented than the game like “Diablo”, and it’s also more refreshing and smooth to play. In short, this time, they really put all the fun ideas they can think of into a piece of work. Why do they do this? The reason is very simple. They haven’t received any business that can earn money for a long time. With only a little development funds left, James said to the company’s people, “if we can’t make a game and make profits within one year, I’m afraid we’ll really shut down.”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How warframe became the best free game on the earth's surface/8777e974cfe34c17bec2066b8ffba6b6.jpg" alt="How warframe became the best free game on the earth&#39;s surface"><br>Land without owner 2 game screen</p>
<p>#”Lotus”<br>No matter at home or abroad, there is a consensus in the field of online games: there are two types of games, one is science fiction, the other is science fiction, because science fiction is too small. What kind of online game is the most popular now? The answer is e-Competition. After all, it’s fun to fight with people. Different fights with different people can keep players fresh all the time. PVE games not only need to invest more resources, but also have playability. If the update progress can’t keep up with it, the players will lose easily. Compared with PVE with high expenditure and low income, PVP is relatively stable.<br>Obviously, de stepped on two mines at the same time. They made a demo named “Lotus” for the new work like they once publicized “dark zone”, and looked for free game agents everywhere, hoping to get as much money as possible for game development, but basically all companies refused them, because this demo was not only made by science fiction plus PVE, but also by virtual engine , you know this is a free game. If you make the picture so good, the future update quality and frequency will become a burden. What’s more, science fiction PVE, anyone who looks at it will think that the people like de are crazy.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How warframe became the best free game on the earth's surface/11a857ea7878492585137662407215da.jpg" alt="How warframe became the best free game on the earth&#39;s surface"><br>Early game pictures<br>After repeatedly hitting the wall, de has no choice but to bite his teeth and stamp his feet, and they will run the game by themselves. They need to prepare everything from scratch, from servers, community websites, customer service, payment channels and so on. On the other hand, Steve is leading a small number of people in the studio to add more content to the game as much as possible, until the R &amp; D of version 1.0 is completed, which takes only nine months.<br>The final product of this game almost completely uses the concept of “dark zone” in the concept, and the screen performance and visual effect refer to the design concept of the later “dark zone” game. Finally, they named the game “warframe” and took the lead in recording the PC platform. The game adopts the operation mode of free download and charging for props. Players can use cash to buy a kind of special currency called “Platinum” in the game. With this currency, they can buy weapons and armor that other players need to brush continuously. However, the game is not warm and fiery. Although it looks interesting, there are not many people willing to try, so There are still some difficulties to make profits, but the feedback from warframe is undoubtedly more positive.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How warframe became the best free game on the earth's surface/d2f48c591ba547798ff49a12888b68da.jpg" alt="How warframe became the best free game on the earth&#39;s surface"><br>1.0 game screen</p>
<p>#Fair<br>In order to increase the income of the game as soon as possible, de has launched a kind of charging package called “founder package” in the game. To be popular, it is a crowdfunding made by de itself in the game. The founder package contains a set of unique battle armour and weapons for a limited time, as well as a considerable number of “Platinum” and “founder package” contents, so each kind of price Lattice is not the same.<br>Members of the studio are watching the sales volume of the founder’s package every day. The most expensive one is up to $250. What we can’t believe is that players are willing to buy the “founder’s package” at every price, which makes de realize that no matter whether the game is good or bad, at least many people are willing to support this fledgling little game. They are deeply moved. They are grateful to those players who are willing to pay for the founder’s package, and say that these contents will never be in the future Resale. It is worth mentioning that the armour in this suit is called “Excalibur prime (commonly known as” curry P “). It is not only the first set of” prime “armour in the history of the whole game, but also an ancient giant admired by thousands of people.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How warframe became the best free game on the earth's surface/ad81a86dca714447ae5a59b2ad7d6342.jpg" alt="How warframe became the best free game on the earth&#39;s surface"><br>It’s not so handsome, but it’s definitely a symbol of identity<br>Thanks to the “founder package”, de finally got a mouthful of blood returning medicine in the dying state and struggled to get up, but the situation was still different and optimistic. At first, the game was labeled “pay 2 win” because some key props can only be obtained through payment. In the overseas market, this label means that the game is absolutely not worth playing. Almost all players do not like this unfair setting. Since then, de has realized how important “fairness” is in the mind of players, and the props that can only be purchased for payment can also be obtained for free through different channels in the game. It is also from that time on, although the charging intensity of the game is not high, even if krypton gold can play normally, there are many contents that need more time and energy for players It can be obtained, so the player pasted the label of “krypton life”, but fortunately, the quality of these contents is directly proportional to the player’s pay, so the label does not have ironic meaning, and more often, it is just the player playing simply.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How warframe became the best free game on the earth's surface/e0d13b97fd984376b41e5e395b9e728e.jpg" alt="How warframe became the best free game on the earth&#39;s surface"><br>Early key props “orokin reactor” can only be purchased for a fee</p>
<p>#Cycle<br>With the help of the network anchor, the exposure rate of the game is higher and higher, and more and more players enter the game. Therefore, the frequency of de for the game must also be accelerated. As early as de was still seeking sponsorship with the game demo, someone told them that “subsequent updates may become a burden”. However, as a matter of fact, despite the excellent performance of the game’s image, the game’s map uses the mechanism of plate random generation, which not only makes every map different, but also needs to be added if you want to increase the map scale It’s OK to enter more forum materials, so it’s not difficult for De to update. But the difficulty lies in: the game is fair, the players with low base are less willing to pay, so they need more players to have a chance to get higher income, so they find the company that won’t lose 3, valve.<br>Warframe logs in to steam, and the free game itself is a big hot area of steam platform. Such a high-quality work will not catch fire without reason. Under the effect of steam’s huge user base, the number of online games soared to an unprecedented height.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How warframe became the best free game on the earth's surface/67081a4c785f4ea8b3b0deae669e0a2c.jpg" alt="How warframe became the best free game on the earth&#39;s surface"><br>Stream page of warframe, with a high praise rate of 92%<br>Finally, De is out of the state of dying struggle, but at the same time, the game doesn’t leave them time to rest. Since the problem of money is solved, it’s time to focus on the update of the game. Rebecca Ford is not only dubbing the role “Lotus” in warframe, but also the operation director of the game community. Her team always pays attention to the players’ feedback in the forum, where there is a bug, what is the most vocal content, and where there is a dispute that needs to be modified. She has a record of all these contents and hands them over to the development team for processing, while the development team While solving these problems, the team will also consider “what kind of content will be interesting to join”, so as to form a perfect cycle. The update of the game will not worry about no way to start, nor about the source of inspiration. Every once in a while, the team will make a big update for the game, add completely different content experience to the game, and keep the players fresh at all times.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How warframe became the best free game on the earth's surface/836c5de180d44030b2040322cd952f77.jpg" alt="How warframe became the best free game on the earth&#39;s surface"><br>Huge player community</p>
<p>#Status quo<br>Today, the volume of warframe is not the same as it used to be. It integrates action shooting, collection and cultivation, open world, flight strategy and many other contents. This may be the most content you can see in a free game. The picture and optimization of the game are constantly updated and improved, so that it does not lag behind many 3A masterpieces. Warframe’s success today is inseparable from the efforts of every employee of De, from every person who has extended a helping hand to it, from every player who has given support and recognition, and from the company itself.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How warframe became the best free game on the earth's surface/cb610c0bbd2340baad13cc6f3ef54137.jpg" alt="How warframe became the best free game on the earth&#39;s surface"><br>The high-quality game community that de has accumulated over the years may be the wealth that many other games can’t obtain in their lifetime. Warframe’s journey over the years is worthy of learning and respect from many other manufacturers. We hope that in the future, we can have more high-quality games like warframe, rather than using the game as a tool to earn a wave and run.</p>

    <title>In 30 years, few people have surpassed, see how a generation of game boy can create a legend</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/In%2030%20years,%20few%20people%20have%20surpassed,%20see%20how%20a%20generation%20of%20game%20boy%20can%20create%20a%20legend/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>On April 20 this year, Nintendo’s game boy, a handheld game machine, celebrated his thirtieth birthday. Although it is not the first handheld machine in history, it is definitely the most influential and famous. Even now, game boy’s sales can also be ranked at the top of the sales list in the whole game machine industry. If its subsequent derivative products (colored GBC and portable version of GBP) are counted as one of them, its sales can reach an amazing 120 million, which can be called a legend of an era, and it is also the first product that dare to challenge the status of the game console.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In 30 years, few people have surpassed, see how a generation of game boy can create a legend/77ba9a99ce6048eebe8885edf6153221.jpg" alt="In 30 years, few people have surpassed, see how a generation of game boy can create a legend"><br>But the players who have been playing video games since that time will probably know that game boy has not much advantage in performance, nor is it a very novel original new machine. On the model, there are even many latecomers who can surpass game boy, but only game boy really laughs at the end. The success of game boy is not the result of strong wind, but also a lot of hard work and sweat.<br>     fumble<br>The concept of “portable game machine” has been formed as early as the 1970s. The first manufacturer to make this concept into a real product is matte, a toy manufacturer from California, USA. in 1976, matte launched a handheld computer called “matte electronic auto race”, which is the first handheld electronic in the real sense Recreational machines.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In 30 years, few people have surpassed, see how a generation of game boy can create a legend/9a677dc7f0124c53a4f4f0cc444f3676.jpg" alt="In 30 years, few people have surpassed, see how a generation of game boy can create a legend"><br>“Mattel electronic racing” pilot<br>Later, Mattel also launched handhelds of different styles and playing methods, such as “e-football”, “e-basketball”, “e-football”, etc., but all of them have a common feature that one machine can only play one game. In order to get rid of this bondage, Mattel later launched the “micro vision”, which can support the replacement of game content, in 1979. Mattel’s “micro vision” design concept is quite advanced. The game is placed on the removable palm case with the main board, and the effect of replacing different games is achieved by replacing different cases. The world’s first palm with expansibility is recorded in the history of the world, but the price is expensive due to the advanced concept of the palm itself, and the battery will overheat And burn the phenomenon of motherboard, so slowly fade out of the players’ vision.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In 30 years, few people have surpassed, see how a generation of game boy can create a legend/c9ab8839cdaa4e0db60d6cc720a6a13c.jpg" alt="In 30 years, few people have surpassed, see how a generation of game boy can create a legend"><br>Mattel “micro vision” handheld<br>At that time, Nintendo was just entering the video game industry. After they launched their first video game platform, “color TV Game 6”, they planned to build a handheld like Mattel, but Mattel’s handheld was too generic, and they wanted to do better, but after all, Nintendo was still in its infancy, so they had to explore it slowly One year after the launch of Mattel’s micro vision, Nintendo learned from Mattel’s lessons and started at a low speed. It launched the dot matrix camera “game &amp; watch”, which is also a one machine one-time tour, but with a color screen sticker background.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In 30 years, few people have surpassed, see how a generation of game boy can create a legend/47b41e4f5b5147d296399d6fb6cebc50.jpg" alt="In 30 years, few people have surpassed, see how a generation of game boy can create a legend"><br>All kinds of “game &amp; watch”<br>The birth of “game &amp; watch” has something to do with a man named Yokai Junping. The design inspiration of “game &amp; watch” comes from the sight of someone playing with a calculator because of boredom while riding on Shinkansen. In order to try out all kinds of ideas, “game &amp; watch” has launched about 60 kinds of styles and more than 10 kinds, including all kinds of Nintendo’s fantastic ideas, including flip screen, split screen, removable handle, cross key, etc. It’s easy for us to understand. It can be said that many design ideas of “game &amp; watch” have a direct impact on the design of many subsequent models of Nintendo.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In 30 years, few people have surpassed, see how a generation of game boy can create a legend/f190d37070d14fbcb174b56143b7a08b.jpg" alt="In 30 years, few people have surpassed, see how a generation of game boy can create a legend"><br>At first glance, this clamshell “game &amp; watch” thought it was NDS<br>  second attempt<br>At the same time, Walkman, introduced by Sony, has become popular all over the world, changing players’ perception of digital products due to its novel design of replaceable card tape. Yokai Junping, who created “game &amp; watch”, was also deeply influenced by it, which also gave him the desire to make a palm with expansibility like Mattel.<br>Although “game &amp; watch” has more than 60 models, and its sales volume has not reached Nintendo’s expectation, which once made Nintendo almost give up its handset business. However, in view of the need to launch another product to fill the gap period before the launch of the next host FC, Nintendo society is still in a position of being a giant Jingjunping’s project has given a green light, but at the same time, it has also ordered yokogai Junping to make a hand machine that will surpass “game &amp; wactch” in an all-round way and its performance will be equal to FC’s. at the same time, the price will be close enough, which is simply to improve, strengthen and control the cost.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In 30 years, few people have surpassed, see how a generation of game boy can create a legend/4be25cd1512c4d19aeea02c70769d2df.jpg" alt="In 30 years, few people have surpassed, see how a generation of game boy can create a legend"><br>Yokai Junping, father of game boy (late)<br>It’s difficult to achieve all these goals with the strength of Yokai Junping alone. Therefore, Yokai Junping found shangmurakami from sharp, a hardware supplier. They decided to cooperate in the design and development of new machines. Referring to the previous “game &amp; watch” design concept, yokogai Junping maximized the portability of the new machine, and added three-dimensional channel and multi person online function to it. At the same time, he also planned to transplant many first-party masterpieces on FC platform to the new machine to enhance the first game lineup of the new machine.<br>But even though everything seems to be going well, there are problems in the hardware of the screen: after all, President Yamauchi has the order to strictly control the cost of the new model, so Yokai does not plan to use the color screen on the new model, but the same TN LCD black-and-white screen as “game &amp; watch”. This kind of LCD screen is similar to the specifications we usually use on calculators. It is usually more clear when we look at it sideways rather than from the front. However, the size and shape of the new model are far from the “game &amp; watch”, so when we hold it, we can’t see it sideways as before, and even feel serious residual shadows and very unclear pictures when we play.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In 30 years, few people have surpassed, see how a generation of game boy can create a legend/f201c1c76a204270af6615943b0c9221.jpg" alt="In 30 years, few people have surpassed, see how a generation of game boy can create a legend"><br>The 76 year old masakura<br>This kind of thing is bound to fail. President Yamauchi stopped the development of the new machine. At this time, shangmurakami came forward to tell President Hengjing and President Yamauchi: he heard from his colleagues in the previous company where the headquarters is developing a display screen with new technology, and there has been no small progress. Using this display screen may solve this problem. Although the cost has increased slightly, Yamauchi is not willing to let the production of the new machine fall short. After all, if it is not done, the money invested before will be wasted. They have to unify this transaction. Finally, the problem of image display was solved by many attempts and adjustments of various employees, and it was successfully moved to the shelves in April 1989. However, only the balance of hardware is not enough to establish the success of GB, and the greater reason is attributed to software.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In 30 years, few people have surpassed, see how a generation of game boy can create a legend/d926084161e94ca4bca25f4507fb40be.jpg" alt="In 30 years, few people have surpassed, see how a generation of game boy can create a legend"><br>The GB screen is not so much black and white as black and green<br>End of  : our hands are addictive<br>Before GB’s sale, Nintendo had a long-lasting “psychological war” with yadali and Sega. From Russia, Nintendo got the right to sell the computer and mainframe of Tetris, a video game that was popular all over the world at that time. In the future, we just need to know that Tetris was always a PC Game before, but it has also been a PC game Let the world know how many people indulge in it. Before that, Yamauchi asked Nintendo producer Miyamoto: is the game fun? And Miyamoto’s answer is, “of course, it’s fun. Your family are playing too.” This also let Nintendo know the charm of this game.<br>Nintendo chose to bundle the game with the game boy handheld, attracting a large number of players’ desire to buy with the gimmick of “Tetris” that can be carried with them. Many people chose to buy new machines with the idea that “I bought GB just to play Tetris”, which also led a wave of GB sales.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In 30 years, few people have surpassed, see how a generation of game boy can create a legend/e3226d275e6c448e8022baa3bc9b6b16.jpg" alt="In 30 years, few people have surpassed, see how a generation of game boy can create a legend"><br>GB version of Tetris<br>The game works that let GB take the computer to the sky step by step are not the legend of Zelda: Dream Island, or Super Mario, but the Pokemon (now called “fairy treasure dream”). With the coming of PS host, many game developers have turned to Sony, which made GB’s game lineup very depressed. At that time, game freak, the second-party manufacturer of Nintendo, came out and tried to open up the children’s game market by designing an animal to animal game. This was the first time to log in to GB’s Pokemon: Red / green.<br>At first, the game didn’t achieve much success, and even was criticized by the players because of the game bug. But after all, it is a game product for children’s market. How can there be no propaganda measures? So the animation and comics adapted from the game have been launched one after another. The cross-border publicity of animation and comics relies on high-quality plot and production success to earn people’s attention, and they have rushed to buy GB and Pokemon. GB has become the existence that players can’t let go of, day and night can be a dream.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In 30 years, few people have surpassed, see how a generation of game boy can create a legend/3593dbafbaba46a9a01e60a818365484.jpg" alt="In 30 years, few people have surpassed, see how a generation of game boy can create a legend"><br>Pokemon: Red / green game cover<br>Since then, Nintendo has realized the importance of software for a game machine. The performance deficiencies can be made up by the quality of the game. If the game is not fun, no matter how strong the machine performance is, it will not help. So there is now Nintendo host “full screen game” of the view. But the joke is the joke. Who would deny that Nintendo’s game is not funny?<br>Game boy plays an important role in the whole history of game development. It not only creates brilliant works by Nintendo, but also guides many later game manufacturers. It is like a burning candle, which inspires others and submerges itself in the long river of history with the passage of time. Although it is so out of the water now, it has left us Beautiful memories can never be forgotten.</p>

    <title>I don&#39;t know when to start, there is a new wave of mecha in the game circle</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/I%20don&#39;t%20know%20when%20to%20start,%20there%20is%20a%20new%20wave%20of%20mecha%20in%20the%20game%20circle/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In February this year, the mecha action game “hymn” developed by the studio BioWare under EA officially went on sale, which excited many players who were excited by watching the trailer earlier, saying that they had been impatient to think of the feeling of being a steel man in the game. However, when the game was released, the players found that the actual content of the game was far from the description on the original trailer, giving a feeling of being cheated, and the word-of-mouth of the game fell sharply, thinking that at the beginning, how many players did not know how much they had fantasized about the work, and now the fantasy is also broken.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/I don't know when to start, there is a new wave of mecha in the game circle/5011e014213949868d3d4ea65906f34b.jpg" alt="I don&#39;t know when to start, there is a new wave of mecha in the game circle"><br>As we all know, there are all kinds of mecha games, but only a small proportion in the field of games, but the players who like mecha games don’t know how many. The theme of mecha is not limited to the field of games, including film and television, animation, and model play. Every boy will feel hot because of the friction of gears on mecha, the collision of metals, and the gushing of steam. Therefore, the “mecha culture” across many fields is also called “man’s romance”. And we don’t know when to start, it’s not hard to find that not only are there large foreign factories starting to play the game of machine armour, but also many domestic manufacturers start to have ideas, just as if there is any chance, the game of machine armour suddenly becomes popular.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/I don't know when to start, there is a new wave of mecha in the game circle/89a309b4c2d54e539c5884199853a641.jpg" alt="I don&#39;t know when to start, there is a new wave of mecha in the game circle"></p>
<h1 id="less-people-doesn’t-mean-cool"><a href="#less-people-doesn’t-mean-cool" class="headerlink" title="less people doesn’t mean cool"></a>less people doesn’t mean cool</h1><p>In the early years of the game circle, the robot game is a big one, but although there are many kinds of games, few of them can really be called hot. Mecha culture is mainly popular with Japan. Under the framework of “no separation in ACG field”, both games and animation are very popular. When it comes to Japan, we may think of Kodak first, but in fact, the main active field of Kodak is not in the game circle, mainly animation and model, and the game is only a derivative product. The Super Robot War series released by the Wandai Nanmeng palace is a carnival for the fans of robot animation. It is a strategic role-playing game, which gathers classic characters from various robot animation, and can realize the multi-dimensional chaos of many robot animation.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/I don't know when to start, there is a new wave of mecha in the game circle/115a7732302842d484c7f7e575311c77.jpg" alt="I don&#39;t know when to start, there is a new wave of mecha in the game circle"><br>Once the game was launched, it was deeply loved by mecha fans. But now it’s nearly 30 years since the first generation of the game was launched. Dozens of works have been launched, and people who like those classic characters are not young. The new generation has little feelings for these “old antiques”, but as the author said at the beginning, not many boys will resist mecha《 In this way, with the support of fans, the series of “aircraft battle” came here tenaciously.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/I don't know when to start, there is a new wave of mecha in the game circle/7e66f31a69de45cca15efab1b0bb35fb.jpg" alt="I don&#39;t know when to start, there is a new wave of mecha in the game circle"><br>In terms of animation performance, “aircraft battle” has the performance effect of not losing animation<br>There is another work in Japan, which is remembered by people by CG animation with a strong “hard science fiction” flavor, but few players have ever played this work. This is the armor core series produced by fromSoftware. FS has played “hard core game” all his life, and Armored Core series is no exception. This series is an action game, the quality is good in general, but the threshold of the game is very high, and it is not friendly to new players. In the game, the robot customization system is very powerful. Careful parameter adjustment can make people look big. To create a powerful robot for themselves is not just a work that can be completed by patience. It is because of its very unfriendly difficulty that most players flinch from it, but just like “black soul”, although it is difficult, some people will still like it. The charm of “armor core” can only be really enjoyed by players who like both hard core and machine armor.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/I don't know when to start, there is a new wave of mecha in the game circle/043abdc1a89c4c0a9e5bb68430b17dcd.jpg" alt="I don&#39;t know when to start, there is a new wave of mecha in the game circle"><br>However, due to insufficient technical strength and unsatisfactory sales volume, the Armored Core has been snowed by FS</p>
<p>#The status quo of machine armour games<br>In general, although the robot game has a profound cultural background, it will always be the joy of a small number of players. However, although the audience of the game is small, the relevant film and television works are very popular. Compared with the Japanese hot blood, it seems that people can accept the European and American style of large-scale production. The hot shows of transformers and the Pacific rim are the best proof. Although the “hymn” mentioned at the beginning of the article is also known as machine armor, it tends to be more like the armor of iron man. Although the game is very common, the success of the movie proves one thing to people: machine armor can be accepted by most people, only depends on the selection of materials and game style.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/I don't know when to start, there is a new wave of mecha in the game circle/7f43d03cc3eb448b8ac8a068a35a6277.jpg" alt="I don&#39;t know when to start, there is a new wave of mecha in the game circle"><br>Earlier, “Titan falls” produced by EA also started a good start. The quality of the game itself is not bad, but it is helpless to lack of operation experience and be eager to succeed, which makes the game cold. Since the “hymn” brought the robot back to the players’ vision, there are more robot games on the market. For Sony, in the early Chinese star support program, a Chinese game producer brought a work called “hard core machine a”. From the beginning of the publication of the game, the author paid close attention to the trend of the work. This is a 2D horizontal action game. Players need to operate machine a to perform various tasks.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/I don't know when to start, there is a new wave of mecha in the game circle/bc02fb1563674bb9a46a290cddc5d43f.jpg" alt="I don&#39;t know when to start, there is a new wave of mecha in the game circle"><br>The original name of the game was “code name: hard core”, which is much better than the new name<br>There are two reasons for the series to attract the author. One is that when the game was first released, the author felt that the 2D screen was used but the production was very good. The design of both human and environment can reflect the good intentions of the producer. The other is that the producer is an independent game producer in China, and the game was developed with the help of Sony, which makes the author feel very good Excited, because the robot games themselves are small, let alone the domestic robot games are even fewer, in addition to the domestic independent development of “the great Qin warrior” many years ago, I really can’t think of any other works.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/I don't know when to start, there is a new wave of mecha in the game circle/2514fc6a43724e779f0bc4abd78fb06e.jpg" alt="I don&#39;t know when to start, there is a new wave of mecha in the game circle"><br>“The great Qin warrior” is definitely an underestimated work. Its design concept is very advanced. Unfortunately, it didn’t catch fire<br>In such a mood, reality quickly replied to me: the first one is Netease, which brings a big escape game called “mobile city alpha”. The author once had such an idea, since the big escape game is not in line with the national conditions, and no one is allowed to be injured, why not make a big escape game of robot versus war? Then Netease handed over his answer sheet. In the game, players can summon mecha to fight by accumulating energy. Different characters have different skills. Players can use these characteristics to cooperate and fight.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/I don't know when to start, there is a new wave of mecha in the game circle/762d4666542a4b87987c17c9de37b7a4.jpg" alt="I don&#39;t know when to start, there is a new wave of mecha in the game circle"><br>It used to be called ace. It’s very pleasant to say that it’s quadratic + mecha + eating chicken<br>Tencent can’t be idle after Netease’s action. Its next studio also plans to launch a machine armour fighting game called metal duel. At first glance, the style of the whole game feels familiar. Isn’t that the big fire movie “iron armour and steel fist”? Although the developers have made their own style in this game, they will still give the players a strong sense of both seeing, but fortunately, many players still like this style very much. By the way, the game was planned to be launched in April this year, but it will be finished in June, but it is still missing.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/I don't know when to start, there is a new wave of mecha in the game circle/0f4c9e63a5734595b9432555e17db5ee.jpg" alt="I don&#39;t know when to start, there is a new wave of mecha in the game circle"><br>    concluding remarks<br>As early as the popularity of mobile games, there were many mobile games with the theme of robot armor overseas. The author has contacted several kinds of mobile games, and found that they all have a common fault, that is, the robot armor is very heavy, not as handsome as the robot armor people usually know, and there are no cool weapons and gorgeous special effects. If you compare them, it’s more like a more flexible platform with long legs Gram. The last time I saw this kind of machine armour in the game was in Battlefield 2142 more than ten years ago. It is certain that no one will like this kind of machine armour.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/I don't know when to start, there is a new wave of mecha in the game circle/ecc9601e7e814cfe8a2176d22c997f41.jpg" alt="I don&#39;t know when to start, there is a new wave of mecha in the game circle"><br>Bipedal mecha can be said to be the symbol of Battlefield 2142, but such excellent works are now cool<br>There are different styles of mecha Games launched in the market one after another, which makes a good start for the subsequent games of related subjects. It is not that mecha games are not pleasant, but that they are really not easy to do. The hardline style doomed that this kind of game will only be favored by boys. If it is smashed, it is the real wealth. With the emergence of more and more robot games, especially those made in China, maybe in the future, this niche theme can open up a new road of its own in this new land.</p>

    <title>How to maintain the vitality of the old game</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/How%20to%20maintain%20the%20vitality%20of%20the%20old%20game/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Since the 1980s, it was the most popular and prosperous period of video games. It has a history of nearly 30 years. In the 30 years, we not only witnessed the evolution of video games from the original eight pixels to the top picture which is infinitely close to reality, but also witnessed the birth and glory of a great work or legend series. In the 30 years of history, some works may have been forgotten by people, and some works’ sequels have become “lifetime”. And only a few people know the existence of great influence, perhaps to this day still tenacious to live, and live more moist.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How to maintain the vitality of the old game/317ffbd8e38f444690c98adad3d73cc5.jpg" alt="How to maintain the vitality of the old game"><br>Among these works of “high age”, some of them are consistent, relying on stable and firm quality to win, while others are trying to connect with the new era and organically combine themselves with other elements, with the purpose of trying to live longer as much as possible. And the times are changing, people’s taste and vision are also no matter innovation, how to make the right choice for their own situation has become a big problem that these “time-honored brands” must consider.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How to maintain the vitality of the old game/42164b3b98d6478e86e39becabda8c5b.jpg" alt="How to maintain the vitality of the old game"></p>
<h1 id="mod-and-editor"><a href="#mod-and-editor" class="headerlink" title="mod and editor"></a>mod and editor</h1><p>When it comes to the secret recipe that can prolong the life of the game, it naturally belongs to mod and various editors. In essence, this is that the developers of the game provide some permissions for the players to play a game, improve the open source of the game itself, and encourage the players to participate in the creation of extra content of the game. After all, everyone has different ideas and inspiration, so everyone can create different content, constantly inject fresh blood into the game. This way mostly appears in a single game, and it will follow when the game is launched. Generally, it can improve the playability of a game to the maximum. Making mod for the game can enrich the content of the game, change the model in the game, add some functions for the game itself, and so on. With the help of the editor, you can play the game by yourself in a very simple and understandable way Every element of the game, including the model, map and even the rules of the game can be freely modified by the players, so as to increase more playability on the basis of the original game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How to maintain the vitality of the old game/f161319dca7940e7a2c1e23caa5e0f28.jpg" alt="How to maintain the vitality of the old game"><br>Image quality enhancement mod of gta5<br>Take a few typical examples: the open World RPG game “ancient scroll 5” produced by Bethesda has a very high open source. Because the open world of the game itself has a higher degree of freedom and a more realistic ecosystem than other games, in the eyes of developers and players, this is a world worth exploring. Every time you play, you will have a different feeling, but also Because of this, many players are willing to develop a variety of mods for this game, replace the characters in the game or add new functions, and even some can directly change the game into a completely different game. In terms of making a completely different game, the editor has a greater say, such as the current popular MoBa and big escape type games are derived from games with an editor.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How to maintain the vitality of the old game/e5c75e5976c34d649cf2f964faf413a4.jpg" alt="How to maintain the vitality of the old game"><br>Ancient scroll 5 independent mod “enderal”</p>
<h1 id="stick-to-the-rules"><a href="#stick-to-the-rules" class="headerlink" title="stick to the rules"></a>stick to the rules</h1><p>For a game that has achieved extraordinary results from the beginning, the more difficult it is to continue, the success from the beginning means that the game itself has excellent design in some aspects since its birth, and usually the success of a game means that it can create profits for developers, so in most cases, it will try to launch a sequel. And the word “sequel” means that it can either be equal to or better than the previous one. If it is even a little worse than the previous one, it will be considered as a step backward. In order to successfully launch the sequel and stabilize the reputation of the game, developers usually choose to adjust on the basis of previous works, try to bring some new content to the players on the basis of previous works in each generation of works, or insist on launching works that are not different from previous works according to a mode, but simply change the screen and the general plot.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How to maintain the vitality of the old game/e27b4931c5604237b1e23423635bd9c9.jpg" alt="How to maintain the vitality of the old game"><br>All kinds of sports games are usually out of picture promotion, only need to modify the data<br>Take ghost cry 5, which was released at the beginning of this year, for example. Its first generation of works was born in 2001, which is still an old IP with a history of 18 years. When it was born, it was called the benchmark of action game in the industry. Even the Ghost Warrior series, which was earlier than his birth, failed to win this honor. It is also called “three generation act” game together with Ares and forbearance dragon series. For a long time, the series of “ghost cry” has been selling points with elegant scene design, handsome and gorgeous fighting style, full tension plot performance and deeply rooted characters. If these key points are inherited to ensure their quality, then this game will not be worse. The most obvious example is that the second generation of the series of leading role Games has changed the leading role from a glib ruffian to a cold and dark boy, so the sales volume of the game has been directly impacted. There is a gap of nearly ten years between the four and five generations. I thought that the five generations would have a drastic reform, but I didn’t expect that they were still familiar with the original taste, but the picture became better and the content was rich.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How to maintain the vitality of the old game/09d5ceee7af7408f979537a86c47eed5.jpg" alt="How to maintain the vitality of the old game"><br>It’s hard to find out the faults in the completion of “ghost cry 5”</p>
<h1 id="self-innovation"><a href="#self-innovation" class="headerlink" title="self innovation"></a>self innovation</h1><p>For a series of games, perhaps the most difficult thing is to try to add innovation to each generation of works, especially for works with relatively fixed and single playing methods. Generally, the works that want to try in the new works are either bad at the beginning and want to recover the situation through innovation, or limited and the change of the times, afraid that the consistent will not be accepted by the mainstream. As for how to innovate the game, let’s see what the developers have to refer to and whether the IP in hand can be applied to this idea. The advantage of this approach is that it is very easy to fill and modify the shortcomings in the game with new elements, while the disadvantage is that many times, the ideas with good consistency in the eyes of developers are not matched or even have negative effects from the perspective of players.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How to maintain the vitality of the old game/cd5f945bd5f84d40bf263bd87f65c3d1.jpg" alt="How to maintain the vitality of the old game"><br>Call of Duty: modern war, a new edition of comprehensive innovation, is probably the highest quality work in recent years<br>Take the Ares Series in the three act games as an example. As we all know, Ares series always has a large scale, many elements of violence and blood, and takes the Greek mythology in the dark style as the main tone. The operation difficulty of the game is not high. Compared with the complicated tactics of each weapon in ghost cry series, it is much simpler, usually according to the different types of enemies Switch equipment, and the operation of most moves is basically universal. From the first generation to the third generation, the works have always been in a refreshing style, while in the latest series, in view of the revenge story of the protagonist Kratos has ended, so the style of the new work has changed from the main battle to the main narrative, and some RPG elements have been added on the original basis, which makes this work more profound than the previous work, and the game process with a slightly slower rhythm is quite in line with the role For an influential work of some years, the seemingly drastic reform has actually become a bonus item of the game. We have to admit that the reform of the development team is very bold, but more complementary.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How to maintain the vitality of the old game/05c6a80e96d24d92ac79d3f371ac3a1e.jpg" alt="How to maintain the vitality of the old game"><br>The new ares is even better than the previous one. The game of the year is not played<br>    concluding remarks<br>It’s not easy to maintain a game’s vitality. A slight change is likely to affect the tone and style of the integrated game since its birth. If there’s a little carelessness, it’s likely to hit the signboard. Therefore, if these games need to be adjusted or changed, they also need a lot of deliberation and long-term polishing. Generally, works with the same or even better quality can be kept for many years, which are popular and influential.</p>

    <title>In order to adapt to the style exchange of the times, all of Sega&#39;s Games took the wrong script</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/In%20order%20to%20adapt%20to%20the%20style%20exchange%20of%20the%20times,%20all%20of%20Sega&#39;s%20Games%20took%20the%20wrong%20script/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Towards the end of the year, major game manufacturers began to fight for the game market at the last moment of this year, such as the super fog “dead and stranded”, the world’s first IP “baokemeng: Sword / shield” and the legendary classic “Shamu 3”, which were released one after another under the public’s attention. Even EA also quietly launched “Star Wars Jedi” which became the biggest dark horse in November. Finally, this game All of a sudden, the war became very exciting. In addition to the major works that have been released, many players also pay close attention to those new works that will be released in the near future, such as “cyberpunk 2077” and “Final Fantasy 7re” that countless players are looking forward to.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In order to adapt to the style exchange of the times, all of Sega's Games took the wrong script/84a262c13f22473995562c4aa4a13844.jpg" alt="In order to adapt to the style exchange of the times, all of Sega&#39;s Games took the wrong script"><br>Among many upcoming works, I pay special attention to Sega’s “Cherry Blossom war” series and “dragon like” series, which are about to usher in new works that haven’t been seen for a long time. However, the painting style is not what we were familiar with at that time: the new cherry blossom war changed from strategy game to action game, while “dragon like 7” changed from action game to turn RPG, even “No.1 in the world” ”Jrpg’s “goddess strange news 5” will also launch the derivative “peerless” game “P5s: Ghost pioneer”, which makes people feel funny and wonder if they have taken the wrong script, and the sudden style change also makes people worry about the quality of the game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In order to adapt to the style exchange of the times, all of Sega's Games took the wrong script/566eb39a013e4ffca549f7ce6fb089f5.jpg" alt="In order to adapt to the style exchange of the times, all of Sega&#39;s Games took the wrong script"></p>
<h1 id="“strategy”-to-“action”"><a href="#“strategy”-to-“action”" class="headerlink" title="“strategy” to “action”"></a>“strategy” to “action”</h1><p>For many post-80s and post-90s players, the name “Cherry Blossom battle” will not be unfamiliar in childhood. Many people start to contact the host game from Sega Saturn, and “Cherry Blossom battle” with bright style and rich content is one of the reasons for these players to buy Sega Saturn. The first generation of “Cherry Blossom battle” was born in 1996, and it was the first to log in to the Sega Saturn host. If those who have not been exposed to this series of players look at it now, the “Cherry Blossom battle” series is like a love game of characters with a very clear style of painting and the theme of which is a great style. This is not surprising, after all, “Cherry Blossom war” is indeed a text adventure based game, but in fact, another core of the game is the turn system strategy.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In order to adapt to the style exchange of the times, all of Sega's Games took the wrong script/bcf2a019e4ae40c686ce0cc4365f22c4.jpg" alt="In order to adapt to the style exchange of the times, all of Sega&#39;s Games took the wrong script"><br>Cherry Blossom battle in the early period<br>The game puts time in the “Taizheng period” of the overhead history set by Dazheng. The player plays the main role of the leader of the imperial Chinese attack group. He needs to lead his team members to drive the mecha and fight against the “black nest” organization. What the player has to do is to establish a trust relationship with the members of the imperial Chinese attack group (all women), unite the mentality of the team members and manage the troops The proportion of daily life and character adventure is high, and the character players with high trust can develop a closer love relationship with them. Mecha plus love, this setting can be said to be very offensive to male players. At the same time, the image of several characters in the game is very full and vivid, and has a very high quality game score, making it highly praised when it is launched.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In order to adapt to the style exchange of the times, all of Sega's Games took the wrong script/5450ba3370924736840853c3ae159eb1.jpg" alt="In order to adapt to the style exchange of the times, all of Sega&#39;s Games took the wrong script"><br>People who have played will be impressed by every character in the game<br>However, with the increasingly fierce host war, Sega’s host sales have been losing one after another, and the cherry blossom war, which has always been monopolized by Sega platform, has also been naturally affected. In addition, in order to adapt to the change of the times, the sales volume of Cherry Blossom war 5, which has greatly changed its style, has been bleak, and this series has fallen into silence. It was not until 2016 that Sega held a “hope to revive IP” vote, and “Cherry Blossom war” became the most voted IP. In order to respond to the fans’ expectations, Sega had this “new cherry blossom war”. But what surprised fans was that not only the design of the game, but also the original design of the Royal user, yasuke Fujishima, was changed to the author of the “death” series for a long time, and even the game mode changed from the original turn based strategy to the action game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In order to adapt to the style exchange of the times, all of Sega's Games took the wrong script/90900f64238744a1b1b2cf3ba42badee.jpg" alt="In order to adapt to the style exchange of the times, all of Sega&#39;s Games took the wrong script"><br>New cherry blossom war<br>If the change of human settings is due to the failure of the original painter yasuke Fujishima, the most incomprehensible thing is that the game mode has become act. According to filmmaker onoche, the current number of people who like strategy games is not as good as that of the previous years. In order to gain new fans and revive IP influence, such change is necessary. It makes sense to say so, but one of the biggest problems that Sega ignores: the people that this series needs to meet are the players who expect this series to revive. If we focus on attracting new players, it means that we will abandon our existing “bottom guarantee”. We don’t know whether we can attract new players, but we will offend the old players.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In order to adapt to the style exchange of the times, all of Sega's Games took the wrong script/35cc573445124889bee7d96b2f3a9482.jpg" alt="In order to adapt to the style exchange of the times, all of Sega&#39;s Games took the wrong script"><br>Real combat picture</p>
<h1 id="“action”-to-“RPG”"><a href="#“action”-to-“RPG”" class="headerlink" title="“action” to “RPG”"></a>“action” to “RPG”</h1><p>If we want to say that Sega’s most popular top-notch works now, then the “dragon like” series must be worthy of it. The “dragon like” series has a quite strong local flavor, which is regarded by many players as the spiritual sequel of the “Shamu” series. Few of the series take Japanese Jidao as the theme of the game, which is a game that is thoroughly made for the Japanese to play. So far, the game has launched seven orthodox works and many derivative works, focusing on the protagonist Tong Sheng’s bitter life in the underworld. The game itself is designed in the form of a box court, and the map is not big but has a high density. The game itself is mainly composed of a lively fight and a wonderful story of Jidao. In addition, there are many things that the protagonist can do in his spare time. If the battle and the main line are left behind, it can be regarded as a small game hodgepodge.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In order to adapt to the style exchange of the times, all of Sega's Games took the wrong script/e95883364ca347b0bb677f7f122228e8.jpg" alt="In order to adapt to the style exchange of the times, all of Sega&#39;s Games took the wrong script"><br>Dragon 0<br>The story of Tong Sheng Yima, the dragon of Tangdao, finally came to an end in Rulong 6. Although it didn’t meet the expectations of fans, there was a fair end. Soon after, players received the derivative work eyes of judgment, which belongs to the same universe of shenmuriao, and also achieved good reputation and sales volume. But just as players thought that future works would be around As the eye of judgment continues, Sega unexpectedly publishes Rulong 7. Although a leading role was changed, the overall feeling is still the original flavor. However, in the subsequent promotion, Sega said that the combat mode of this work was changed greatly, and the RPG system of command turn was changed, which caused the players’ dissatisfaction immediately.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In order to adapt to the style exchange of the times, all of Sega's Games took the wrong script/6f01b8dd44574e90a466c0cfb96a0dc6.jpg" alt="In order to adapt to the style exchange of the times, all of Sega&#39;s Games took the wrong script"><br>Combat interface<br>From the introduction, it seems that there are different “professions” for different roles. Some of them act as “soldiers” and some act as “mages”. The way of fighting is also all kinds of funny. It seems that there is a bit of sand carving flavor and some funny. But Rulong always takes hardline action as a major selling point. Although the setting of the command turn system is quite interesting, if it is taken as an outside part Works of a biographical nature may not cause such protests from players. As early as this year’s April Fool’s day, Sega released the news that the new work like a dragon would be a turn RPG. At that time, the players would laugh and laugh as a joke. But unexpectedly, they were serious. For this reason, Sega said that because the new protagonist is no longer a fierce man like Tong Sheng Yima, who can create the Dragon Cave independently, he needs to fight with his partner, and in order to highlight this The best way to set it is RPG.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In order to adapt to the style exchange of the times, all of Sega's Games took the wrong script/3b502a074a7347c6bcf3cb44fcc03c7d.jpg" alt="In order to adapt to the style exchange of the times, all of Sega&#39;s Games took the wrong script"><br>It is said that the command turn system of this work plays “like an action game”<br>    concluding remarks<br>As for “P5” changed to matchless game, in view of the word-of-mouth explosion of “goddess’s strange news 5 Royal edition”, players are increasingly looking forward to the new plot of “P5s”, and the development of the game is in the charge of glory, I believe that glory will also adhere to the concept of “everything can be matchless” and “take it seriously”. On the other hand, vanilla club, a subsidiary of Atlus, a developer of “the strange news of Goddess”, has made a lifetime of 2D horizontal action games (hazy village and dragon crown). Their upcoming “Thirteen machine soldier defense circle” will be their first attempt at text adventure and strategic play, and their feelings will eventually form a closed loop. The four games have exchanged type planning with each other, which really makes them Some people laugh and laugh.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In order to adapt to the style exchange of the times, all of Sega's Games took the wrong script/85ed05d33d2046f8a56dba4f191c8b0c.jpg" alt="In order to adapt to the style exchange of the times, all of Sega&#39;s Games took the wrong script"><br>The continuous operation of Sega really shows that some of the players are numb, which is undoubtedly a very risky move for them, but from another point of view, they may also change the game type in order to be able to have more audience groups for these old IPS, so that these works can have new clusters in the new generation, but simply speaking, The style of “new cherry blossom war” and “dragon 7” has greatly changed, which offended the old players, while “P5s” may only make the players feel a little confused, but the vanilla club has not really sold a game so far, but it has to try a strategy game with a small base. In summary, it is really difficult to give people a sign of “they can succeed”. I hope Shijia really knows what they are doing What kind of attempt, also hope that these works may give players a surprise.</p>

    <title>How can a good Professional Storytelling game company suddenly go bankrupt</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/How%20can%20a%20good%20Professional%20Storytelling%20game%20company%20suddenly%20go%20bankrupt/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>It was a normal working day. Peter holly called hundreds of people under his hand to the conference room. All the staff were curious about this. Why did they have a meeting suddenly, and only received the notice one and a half hours before the meeting? Some people hear that the company has a new investor, which may be to announce good news; some people think that the company has a new large-scale plan, which needs to mobilize the majority of people to participate; some people think that the company’s situation is not optimistic, which may be the decision to announce the layoff.<br>In fact, it’s really guessed by this small group of people. The goal of this meeting is really to lay off workers, but it’s not only to lay off so many as ten or twenty. This cut is to lay off 90% of the company’s people, and let all the laid-off people leave the company within 30 minutes, leaving only 25 people to deal with the rest of the aftermath work, all because the company is bankrupt.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How can a good Professional Storytelling game company suddenly go bankrupt/bff152f26e034997af68769d5507c9ec.jpg" alt="How can a good Professional Storytelling game company suddenly go bankrupt"><br>There was no severance payment, insurance expired, hundreds of people lost their jobs at the same time, some were crying on the ground, some were hugging each other and comforting each other, everything came so unprepared, and the subsequent game distribution work was cancelled.<br>This company is called telltale, which is also legendary in the game circle. Like their name, this is a company specialized in “story telling” games. Many IP players are looking forward to a sequel. The sudden collapse of tallale shocked the whole game circle, and everyone was very surprised. How could a good end fail suddenly?</p>
<h1 id="“story-telling-professional”"><a href="#“story-telling-professional”" class="headerlink" title="“story telling professional”"></a>“story telling professional”</h1><p>When it comes to talltalk, we have to talk about adventure games (AVG). In the earliest PC games, there was no image but text, and players could only use instructions to control the characters’ adventures in the game. At that time, only the text adventure games could be equated with PC games.<br>After the progress of computer graphics technology, Japanese AVG and European and American AVG have chosen two different ways, the former is a kind of audio novel mainly based on text and plot, and the player can only make a choice according to the plot; the latter is a kind of decryption game that uses mouse click to collect clues to promote the game. At that time, among the European and American AVG game manufacturers, Lucas arts was one of the best. Its subsidiaries, such as “clever detective breaking through customs”, “Monkey Island little hero”, “Rhapsody of the underworld” and so on, among which “Rhapsody of the underworld” won the annual AVG game at one stroke.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How can a good Professional Storytelling game company suddenly go bankrupt/599e92da771b46ab9f74a0f5cab89cd2.jpg" alt="How can a good Professional Storytelling game company suddenly go bankrupt"><br>The picture of Rhapsody of the underworld is slightly funny, but actually tells a very warm story<br>Many people think of Rhapsody of the underworld as the peak of AVG and the last peak of AVG. Although the quality of the game is excellent, the sales volume is unsatisfactory. Why? At that time, because of the innovation wave of integrity video games, action games became popular, even adventure games were replaced by more enjoyable action adventure games, and the saying “adventure game is dead” began to spread in the market.<br>In 2004, in order to meet the market demand, Lucas art announced the cancellation of its two traditional AVG game sequels, which led to the dissatisfaction of several employees within the company, so they left and set up telltale studio. They are all concerned about making the traditional AVG game come back to the players’ vision, and the primary goal is to first make the sequel of “smart agent breaking through customs” cancelled by Lucas art. They find the original comic writer of this work, and come to the comic IP to make the game. They choose to publish the game in the form of chapters to maintain the game Popularity, this practice continues to this day, and even affects the distribution strategy of many other games.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How can a good Professional Storytelling game company suddenly go bankrupt/75d14429f8c040008a15250f8b365909.jpg" alt="How can a good Professional Storytelling game company suddenly go bankrupt"><br>The cartoon picture of “clever detective breaking through customs 2” is very pleasing<br>For many years since then, talltalk has been making traditional AVG games by scraping the popular IP from all over the world to make a living, such as Jurassic Park, back to the future, or the animation “super invincible leader dog”. It has to be said that these IP are really ancient level, which coincides with the game type of AVG.<br>Most of these games are rated average, sales are average, and the results are fairly good. They know that the audience of these games is not as good as they used to be. They just need to do their job well and don’t expect to achieve much success, so they lower the threshold a little and earn enough money for the company’s employees.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How can a good Professional Storytelling game company suddenly go bankrupt/11d57f91a7b6455aaf6d585b57ce8511.jpg" alt="How can a good Professional Storytelling game company suddenly go bankrupt"><br>“Back to the future” is very good for old fans</p>
<p>#From great joy to great sorrow<br>It wasn’t until 2012 that the comic book “walking dead” adapted from the same name was launched that talltale finally had a prosperous day. Different from the traditional puzzle solving AVG of talltale, the play method of walking dead is more like an interactive movie game. Players often have to face a variety of choices and QTE in the game.<br>Thanks to the strength of the two screenwriters, Sean van naman and Jack Luther King, the plot design of the game is very excellent. With the American play “walking dead” on the air, the game has made great success. This work broke the previous sales record of talltalk, broke the sales volume of millions in one month alone, and won the best game of the year of TGA 2012.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How can a good Professional Storytelling game company suddenly go bankrupt/437047af23c04456a13cf1b5f9c6c79e.jpg" alt="How can a good Professional Storytelling game company suddenly go bankrupt"><br>The success of “walking dead” surprised the whole company. They wanted to continue to copy the success of “walking dead” in their subsequent works, so they began to buy various IPS according to the way of “walking dead”, and completely abandoned the game mode in the AVG game, all of them changed to the same interactive film style as “walking dead”. Maybe this is just It’s the so-called “a pit squatting to death”.<br>Taltale has purchased various IPS successively, and will buy whatever fire he sees. The plots like game of Thrones and Batman and walking dead will only buy from IP. Even the game IPS like land without owner and my world will also be bought. It’s not hard to see that taltaltale is starting to die.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How can a good Professional Storytelling game company suddenly go bankrupt/e9fb40838aeb4c979e90a8ecd15e9094.jpg" alt="How can a good Professional Storytelling game company suddenly go bankrupt"><br>For many players, it’s better to watch others play than to play these games on their own<br>In one year, talltale launched four different IP works, but at this time, the two master writers of the first “walking dead” had left the company’s own door to do “the man watching the fire”. Without the ace screenwriter, such high production means that the quality of the game must be greatly reduced. There are so many games to be played all at once, and they are all different stories. It’s estimated that who will be the playwright will have to be the first one. Therefore, in order to produce the game smoothly, we must make a little “small means”, that is, formula based mass production.<br>As we said before, talltalk’s works are sold in accordance with the chapters, making one chapter and one chapter. Generally, five chapters are a complete season. Although the story of each of the five chapters is different, the structure is basically the same. It feels like playing a game of talltalk is equal to playing all the games of their family. The disadvantages of formulaic games have a long way to go. In the beginning, players may be more willing to pay. Over time, it will make people feel bored and even disgusted with the whole game company.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How can a good Professional Storytelling game company suddenly go bankrupt/b93381c078d04e74820116d055d765ae.jpg" alt="How can a good Professional Storytelling game company suddenly go bankrupt"><br>The plot of “the man watching the fire” is not brilliant, but it is very deep<br>For many years, talltalk has been using a very old game development engine, which has been used from the beginning to the end of the company’s establishment, which has resulted in not only the image quality of the game has not been improved, but also can’t adopt more efficient development methods like the current engine. In order to catch up with the progress, it’s rare to match the completion of the first season of walking dead Not only are there many bugs in the works mentioned and discussed, but also the work of text proofreading is extremely perfunctory. It is not uncommon for the characters with untidy subtitles to cross the wall.<br>The work efficiency is low, and the high-level is rushing to produce new works. One side is going out while the other side is still buying new IPS. In this case, how can we see high-quality works again? Even if the follow-up works of talltalk are not so unattractive, we should know that AVG games are small in nature, so messing with them is definitely not the way to persevere.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/How can a good Professional Storytelling game company suddenly go bankrupt/59c42173533d4e36b41163aa6d71cdd9.jpg" alt="How can a good Professional Storytelling game company suddenly go bankrupt"><br>“The legend of the land without owner” is better than the plot. At first, it’s hard to imagine how to change FPs to AVG<br>    concluding remarks<br>The worst result finally happened. The sales volume of talltale’s works was not as good as that of one. Nearly 400 people who were recruited for high production were also waiting for their meals. If they couldn’t make ends meet, the company would go bankrupt. It’s good that talltale wanted to revive AVG game. But after all, so many years, it’s obvious that talltale didn’t have enough experience and could not do a good job Should be aware that they think that one success can be successful again and again. Originally, AVG game did see a little sign of rising again, and finally let itself be personally watered out.<br>It’s impossible to blame the players for not supporting it. After all, there are many players who are still looking forward to the follow-up works and one by one players, all of which are the responsibility of the company. Fortunately, these unemployed people have been accepted by many front-line companies. I hope they can make some different excellent works in the future by their own talents.</p>

    <title>Focusing on act for more than ten years, platinum studio is not as powerful as we think</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/Focusing%20on%20act%20for%20more%20than%20ten%20years,%20platinum%20studio%20is%20not%20as%20powerful%20as%20we%20think/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>At this year’s E3 game show, Nintendo announced that the exclusive action game “astral chain”, an ns platform exclusive action game created by platinum studio, will be released on August 30 this year. According to the technical strength of platinum studio, we don’t need to worry too much about the quality of the game, but I don’t know why, it seems that not many people are optimistic about the game. The reason is that although the game is hung with the brand of “platinum products”, it doesn’t seem to be as attractive as expected, but it seems that many people have forgotten that this work is platinum work Room for a few original IP, and from the emergence of an original IP has been five years.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Focusing on act for more than ten years, platinum studio is not as powerful as we think/7671511290c246f697ec3d74afaf03d5.jpg" alt="Focusing on act for more than ten years, platinum studio is not as powerful as we think"><br>I have a white gold studio’s die loyal powder around me. Basically, every work produced by white gold is bought and blown, but for a long time, it has almost reached a state of brainless blowing. There are not a few players who like platinum studio, but anyone who mentions this name knows that the action game it produces has unparalleled quality. It’s not how strong platinum is, but its far-reaching reputation doesn’t allow us to live up to others’ expectations. Under the gorgeous appearance, we only know how much we have suffered and how much we have suffered.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Focusing on act for more than ten years, platinum studio is not as powerful as we think/68d631f341db47bd82bfab511c18fb1a.jpg" alt="Focusing on act for more than ten years, platinum studio is not as powerful as we think"></p>
<h1 id="extraordinary-birth"><a href="#extraordinary-birth" class="headerlink" title="extraordinary birth"></a>extraordinary birth</h1><p>When it comes to platinum studios, we have to mention several of its promising co founders: Sanshen, Shengu Yingshu and Daoye dunhi. Third, samurai is the former head of the fourth game development department of Capcom, known for relying on the terrorist shooting game “biochemical crisis” series, so it has the title of “the father of biochemical crisis”. Shengu Yingshu and Daoye dunhi were also members of the fourth Development Department of Capcom. Apart from biochemical crisis, the most powerful act “ghost cry” and the classic reasoning decryption game “reverse referee” were also created by them. They can be said to be a pillar level general under Capcom’s empty hands.<br>That’s when “biochemical crisis” has come out to “code Veronica”, and “biochemical crisis” series has been unknown in the whole game field. At that time, it was just when Nintendo NGC and Sony PS2 were in a fierce battle. Because of the same aspiration and excellent function, we decided to let “biochemical crisis” series completely monopolize the NGC platform.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Focusing on act for more than ten years, platinum studio is not as powerful as we think/d50c666b29dd4979884517fed720362a.jpg" alt="Focusing on act for more than ten years, platinum studio is not as powerful as we think"><br>From left to right: sanshengsi, Shengu Yingshu, Daoye dunhi<br>No one expected that such a surprising decision would be made in the third meeting. Originally, everyone thought that the biochemical crisis series would have a bright future, but in fact, the sales volume of biochemical crisis 0 newly registered in NGC was only 400000. Depressed three times expressed their dissatisfaction to the outside world in an interview: “PS2 and heart of the kingdom can sell Japanese brains in such a bad way…” this caused public opinion in the society, but even so, unwilling three times made several games on NGC, but failed to succeed. In succession, the three losers were “voluntarily resigned” by Capcom and assigned to the four leaf grass studio to develop games and no longer serve as minister, while the main leader of the four leaf grass was to launch the divine Valley Yingshu of “ghost cry” for Capcom.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Focusing on act for more than ten years, platinum studio is not as powerful as we think/139b7bc4fc1848c9a40bcebbbcdda79b.jpg" alt="Focusing on act for more than ten years, platinum studio is not as powerful as we think"><br>After being transplanted to other platforms, the sales volume of “biochemical crisis 0” became considerable<br>After joining four leaf grass studio, he was still loyal to the NGC platform. He produced five games for NGC, including Joey the red man and hand of God, but he still failed to make any dazzling achievements. The reason is that Nintendo’s console sales volume is low and the studio’s experience in marketing and distribution is insufficient, so that no one will go to the game if it is any better Attention and purchase, the final work order was dissolved at the end of 2006, and several creators also chose to leave Capcom.<br>After “running away from home”, several people chose to set up their own doors and set up seeds studio, but the problem also came up: without Capcom, they didn’t know what to do, and if they wanted to do other game series, they had to spend money to buy authorization, but they didn’t have money, and even if they depended on reputation to sponsor, they would not publicize it, which made several people who set up the company have no way for a while, and they happened to have no way Sanbingda, who left from Capcom, also set up the company’s odd. The same experience made them feel sorry for each other. They decided to merge the two companies one after another. The company also changed its name to platinum</p>
<h1 id="“I-want-to-write-a-miserable-word”"><a href="#“I-want-to-write-a-miserable-word”" class="headerlink" title="“I want to write a miserable word”"></a>“I want to write a miserable word”</h1><p>After the establishment of the company, Sega came to the company and hoped that platinum could develop a series of games for it. They were willing to pay for sponsorship and distribution. How can platinum, who is short of money, let go of this opportunity and sign the R &amp; D budget of five games at once. Then we have the well-known “angel hunting witch”, “crazy world”, “infinite route”, “absolute conquest” and “magic 101”. Although these IP addresses are all original IP addresses, none of them belong to platinum itself. After all, Sega is the gold owner of the game. Even though many of these IP addresses have great popularity and sales volume, it has nothing to do with platinum itself. After all, there are no publishers. Even if Platinum wants to play games, there are no conditions. They can’t make their own decisions on this matter.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Focusing on act for more than ten years, platinum studio is not as powerful as we think/fb0f79c84aa34af99ecda786e7260592.jpg" alt="Focusing on act for more than ten years, platinum studio is not as powerful as we think"><br>With the success of several games and the reputation of several producers, platinum studio soon became the focus of attention. From the moment of being concerned, platinum studio stood in a position far beyond others, which means they have no way back. In short, it’s like a person standing at the top of a pyramid. A little down two steps can also be called a step back. So in order to maintain this dignity and avoid repeating the same mistake again, platinum chose to break his teeth and swallow them in his stomach. In 2016, there were only more than 50 people in platinum studio, but in the past ten years, it has launched a total of ten works, and there is no repetition. On average, there will be one game in the next year, which can only be described as amazing efficiency.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Focusing on act for more than ten years, platinum studio is not as powerful as we think/352c276c91c245e28167cdd8bbd02faf.jpg" alt="Focusing on act for more than ten years, platinum studio is not as powerful as we think"><br>Platinum doesn’t want to belong to its original IP, which is certainly impossible. How can they be willing to work for others all the time when they are of extraordinary origin? This belief is not only rooted in the hearts of several creators, but also carried out by the employees. After “absolute conquest” was launched, the founders Sanshen and sanjuda chose to leave, with one of the founders, Daoye dunzhi, as the head of the company. When the company changes its leaders, it is obviously unable to solve the company’s dilemma. The only way out is to change the company’s owners by holding their thighs.</p>
<h1 id="tail-dead-cycle"><a href="#tail-dead-cycle" class="headerlink" title="tail: dead cycle"></a>tail: dead cycle</h1><p>There are two works that really bring about a turnaround for the company. One is the new project “rise of alloy equipment: Revenge” initiated by Xiaodao Xiufu in that year. Although this work is a second-class product in the eyes of orthodox fans of alloy equipment, it can be said that this work is in the history of alloy equipment, relying on the action design originally learned by platinum in his hometown kapukona and the forerunner’s lesson of “angel Hunter” The most gorgeous and successful transformation.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Focusing on act for more than ten years, platinum studio is not as powerful as we think/dc4c1c4e66e448a8beb2d86f3a436f60.jpg" alt="Focusing on act for more than ten years, platinum studio is not as powerful as we think"><br>The success of two pure action games in succession made platinum finally find its own position and have the confidence to dare to try. It seems to outsiders that the action games they made are also quite reassuring. Se, seeing the strength of platinum studio, came to the door without asking and gave them a dusty IP to make. This is the second work Neil: machine Age of arms. How hot is the game? It is the success of the mechanical era that gives platinum a chance to breathe a sigh of relief.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Focusing on act for more than ten years, platinum studio is not as powerful as we think/35cd5ff026b245f4a3ecb4ed35d345cc.jpg" alt="Focusing on act for more than ten years, platinum studio is not as powerful as we think"><br>For more than ten years, platinum has been either outsourcing or negotiating outsourcing. At the same time, it needs to build high-quality games, and at the same time, it needs to earn money to support itself, and it also wants to earn money and fame. But how can it become a first-class developer and 3a game if even qifandu is a problem? All the way down, platinum doesn’t know how many companies it can’t keep up with. If it wants to succeed, it needs to do original work. If it needs money, it needs to hold other people’s thighs. Platinum hasn’t been able to get rid of this dead cycle for a long time.<br>In 2016, platinum said that it must launch its own new IP in three years. Today, three years later, it has fulfilled this promise, but it seems that at this stage, it can not arouse the strong attention of players. No one knows how far platinum will go in the future. As for the score of this answer sheet, we can only wait until the game is released.</p>

    <title>In the corner, making a fortune with a dull voice, on the three extremes of racing game environment</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/In%20the%20corner,%20making%20a%20fortune%20with%20a%20dull%20voice,%20on%20the%20three%20extremes%20of%20racing%20game%20environment/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Nowadays, there are not a few people who like cars. Cars can be used as a substitute for people’s daily travel, or as “large toys” for some enthusiasts’ entertainment. This circle is not small, but it is estimated that the former accounts for much more than the latter. For some reasons, there are quite a few people who can’t reach the existence of such a large-scale machinery as automobiles, so video games have become the best alternative. However, it’s not known that in the circle of video games, speed games may be the existence with the lowest degree of discussion and enthusiasm. You may have seen a famous anchor who doesn’t take the initiative to play a competition with the purpose of just eating Speed game? This alone is enough to prove the claim.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In the corner, making a fortune with a dull voice, on the three extremes of racing game environment/93855709b38a454d850920590896d7c2.jpg" alt="In the corner, making a fortune with a dull voice, on the three extremes of racing game environment"><br>However, in fact, even though car games are a relatively small circle, they are always an indispensable category in the game market. The innovation of car games is not only to adjust the taste of players, but also represents the highest image quality of the current generation of hardware performance. Today’s racing games are mainly divided into three groups, and these three groups almost include all the current mainstream platforms, and the benefits they can bring to the game companies are definitely a force that cannot be underestimated.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In the corner, making a fortune with a dull voice, on the three extremes of racing game environment/9309573a62cf4054b3d9c540840b941d.jpg" alt="In the corner, making a fortune with a dull voice, on the three extremes of racing game environment"></p>
<h1 id="mobile-platform"><a href="#mobile-platform" class="headerlink" title="mobile platform"></a>mobile platform</h1><p>Although for a long time mobile games have been very unpopular with PC players and host players, there is no doubt that the number of players in the mobile game field may be several times that of these players, which is an extremely huge market. For the racing games, it may be able to get stable income guarantee on this platform. At first, the design of the mobile end of the racing game was very immature, which was largely improved by the intervention of some first-line manufacturers. I vaguely remember a friend a long time ago who asked the seller the first question when he changed his mobile phone: “can this mobile phone smoothly run” the best flying car 17 “ This shows that the performance of this game in the mobile platform is quite excellent, not only has a good sense of operation, but also compared with other works in the same period in terms of the performance of the screen, it is the existence of big brother level.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In the corner, making a fortune with a dull voice, on the three extremes of racing game environment/f3a7e4b5b9a245959470e51cfb3c7a76.jpg" alt="In the corner, making a fortune with a dull voice, on the three extremes of racing game environment"><br>“The best flying car: the most wanted” mobile edition<br>There are two oligarchs in the mobile platform’s racing game, one is called CSR racing, and the other is the wild racing, which is well known by the domestic players. Both of them are popular in the global market. Apart from these large-scale production of racing works, there are also domestic mainstream online racing games such as “running kart”, “QQ flying car”. The original PC versions of these games have been in operation for more than ten years now. No matter how excellent the operation of this game is, its popularity is certainly not as good as it was at the beginning. Its own games The picture quality and game configuration of is not hard for the current mobile platform, so moving it to the mobile platform may be a good way to continue the popularity of the game and expand the group of players. The performance of these games on the mobile platform is also quite excellent. Their own games focus on social, and social is just the strength of the mobile platform.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In the corner, making a fortune with a dull voice, on the three extremes of racing game environment/70616bbf5b044bebb84a5fbbdeb749be.jpg" alt="In the corner, making a fortune with a dull voice, on the three extremes of racing game environment"><br>Wild racing 9</p>
<h1 id="host-and-PC"><a href="#host-and-PC" class="headerlink" title="host and PC"></a>host and PC</h1><p>Generally, most of the racing players on the host platform and PC platform are light players. They need simple and direct game fun. If the content of the game itself is less or the playing method is relatively simple, they are likely to encounter a cold situation. In most cases, especially in the domestic game environment, players tend to be passionate and enthusiastic in American style, and pay attention to a cool driving style. The reason for this is largely related to the early Chinese market deeply influenced by the classic flying car. The classic flying car series mainly focuses on the crisp street racing, and many works involve the police Bandit conflict can bring the most intuitive sensory impact to the players. At the same time, the “best flying car” series also has the official authorization of many well-known car factories, allowing the players to drive the vehicles that can be seen in film and television programs or display life in the game, which is often the vehicles that can meet the greatest needs of the players.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In the corner, making a fortune with a dull voice, on the three extremes of racing game environment/f1216624771e46a7af0c4b031a10784f.jpg" alt="In the corner, making a fortune with a dull voice, on the three extremes of racing game environment"><br>The best car 19<br>Then, because of the invariability of the series, the players gradually lost interest in the series. As one of EA’s new year’s products, the series seems to have some general meaning. This gives other competitors the opportunity to enter. At present, the most popular race game on PC and host platform is Microsoft’s “extreme race” series. Whether it’s the true racing car or the open world race “Horizon” with the nature of external transmission, it has a very good performance. This series of works has become the first in the industry today, thanks to its constant updating and iteration throughout the year, so as to ensure the high quality of the game in the long run. Unlike other works, which are always trying to break through the theme and content, each generation of works is a new start and redevelopment, and its completion will be easily compared.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In the corner, making a fortune with a dull voice, on the three extremes of racing game environment/c82c76ab785e4f0182b0d60c3e167c02.jpg" alt="In the corner, making a fortune with a dull voice, on the three extremes of racing game environment"><br>Extreme speed: Horizon 4</p>
<h1 id="hardcore-players"><a href="#hardcore-players" class="headerlink" title="hardcore players"></a>hardcore players</h1><p>For the core players of racing games, they are not so much like racing games as they really like car sports. They will be more inclined to imitate the real racing games, and the more realistic the better the works. They are willing to repeatedly debug their favorite vehicles in these high fidelity racing games, hone their driving skills bit by bit, keep in mind the structure of each track, and strive to make their racing time be able to be rushed into the ranking. Most of these games are based on professional racing themes, such as dust, racing plan, and godly KOSHA, which are especially popular with these players. Usually these games also contain very detailed vehicle adjustment system, and have relatively excellent physical effects and picture performance. The theoretical stimulation degree may be far less than those semi real works In the eyes of outsiders, these games can’t be played by ordinary people at all. It’s not only difficult to start with complicated systems, but also necessary to invest in high-cost purchase of special peripherals. The entry threshold alone is enough to persuade a large number of players.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In the corner, making a fortune with a dull voice, on the three extremes of racing game environment/e43c29a672f1435793dbeadb647ebc12.jpg" alt="In the corner, making a fortune with a dull voice, on the three extremes of racing game environment"><br>Racing plan 2<br>If the pseudo real racing game is upgraded to another level, these works cannot be called racing games, but are called “driving simulators”, and the experience process is also called “simulated racing”. Simulation car racing usually has a set of relatively strict rules and systems, and has a relatively perfect training process. To fully understand and master these contents, it needs to invest a considerable amount of time to learn and practice. In essence, it is not much different from the real car racing in reality, just because it is sitting in front of the screen, so it is better than the real car racing There is a lot of safety, and now there are many car clubs and teams are also using this way to train drivers, which is a huge income for developers.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In the corner, making a fortune with a dull voice, on the three extremes of racing game environment/c3be527c3b7e481188ae7ec14a2ad245.jpg" alt="In the corner, making a fortune with a dull voice, on the three extremes of racing game environment"><br>Simulation racing software Iracing<br>    concluding remarks<br>Different from other kinds of games, what developers need to do is just to create excellent pictures and good physical effects as much as possible. In essence, they just compete with each other on whose speed is faster and whose technology is better. If “walking” in other games is an operation that can be easily executed without brain thinking, then the racing game is to“ The process of “walking” is complicated. Players only need to think about how to make their cars run faster. No matter what theme or mode, the core idea can never be changed. No matter what platform has a solid support and fans, which may be one of the reasons why racing games can flourish forever. Perhaps only a small number of people can realize and understand this fast-paced pleasure at present, but it should be known by more people, and it’s a pity to be a small game for it.</p>

    <title>In the invisible platform of flying, how can blue keep pace with many 3A</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/In%20the%20invisible%20platform%20of%20flying,%20how%20can%20blue%20keep%20pace%20with%20many%203A/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In November 2018, at the so-called “video game Oscar” TGA award ceremony, many top-notch 3A players, such as “God of war” and “wilderness Escort: Redemption 2”, were nominated for the best game of the year. In this list of nominations, it seems that there is something different in painting style. A platform jumping game with pixel style also appears in this list. It is the only independent game in all works, and its playing method is just platform jumping. Compared with other works, it seems so out of place, making it difficult for people not to pay attention to it. The name of the game is “blue”. It’s puzzling why the game appears on this list.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In the invisible platform of flying, how can blue keep pace with many 3A/c3dbec0968254e659d6cb7ee5370c4c5.jpg" alt="In the invisible platform of flying, how can blue keep pace with many 3A"></p>
<h1 id="dream-host"><a href="#dream-host" class="headerlink" title="dream host"></a>dream host</h1><p>Before introducing the game “blue”, I have to mention another name, pico-8, or “fantasy console”. This is a platform that focuses on the development of mini retro games, but it can also be used to play games. The reason why it is called “host” is that the framework design of the development template of this platform is similar to that of the host framework, and the whole platform is also called “host” Its operation style and UI design are very similar to those of the retro game consoles integrating various simulators many years ago, and the official and game developers also call these games “cartridges”. When experiencing the client version of this platform, it feels like playing a 10% retro host. It is worth mentioning that this platform can only be used to make 8bit style games, but because it is built with modern technology, even 8-bit pixels can present a very delicate game picture.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In the invisible platform of flying, how can blue keep pace with many 3A/86abcbfa1e9d4404910a1483d3d09a99.jpg" alt="In the invisible platform of flying, how can blue keep pace with many 3A"><br>Pico-8 home page<br>Back to the point, Celeste was jointly developed by independent game producers Matt Thorson and Noel berry. Their last work, tower down: rising to the sky, was launched in 2014. In recent years, they seem to have disappeared. And that’s one year after tower down: rising to the sky, they spent four days to make a horizontal platform jump game on the “dream host P” pico-8 platform mentioned above, which is the prototype of “blue”, which they call “blue classic”. Pico-8’s “blue classic” can only be described as “simple” with the current vision. The player controls a character who looks like a little girl (because of her long hair) to conquer all levels. In addition to the basic jumping, the protagonist has the ability of “sprinting”, which can achieve the effect of rapid displacement in the air, while many levels are floating Strawberries float as a bonus collection.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In the invisible platform of flying, how can blue keep pace with many 3A/4f156809080e414f9b9ef6ce7b554374.jpg" alt="In the invisible platform of flying, how can blue keep pace with many 3A"><br>Green, red and long hair… Huajing hospital, Dianming!?</p>
<h1 id="platform-jumping-of-abstractionists"><a href="#platform-jumping-of-abstractionists" class="headerlink" title="platform jumping of abstractionists"></a>platform jumping of abstractionists</h1><p>Although the mechanism of the game is not novel, many levels of the game are well designed. The challenging game settings make this little game quickly become the most popular work on the whole platform. In view of the popularity of the game, the two people who developed this work decided to develop this prototype product into a formal version. They spent nearly three years to develop the game. As pico-8 is no longer used as the carrier, the game’s picture, score and scale can be greatly improved, which is the finished product we see now. However, even if the engine with better picture is used, it’s hard to say how excellent its performance is as a pixel style game. The characters in the form of pixels in the game even have no face, but this is not important for the game itself. When the players are in the actual operation, they hardly care about the action and appearance of the characters.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In the invisible platform of flying, how can blue keep pace with many 3A/0069d40979c74a1a8f274d6a59fbdc71.jpg" alt="In the invisible platform of flying, how can blue keep pace with many 3A"><br>The details of the picture are not rich, but they are very eye-catching<br>There is no fight, few enemies, very smooth operation mechanism and well-designed checkpoints are all part of the game, but it seems not enough for a serious game, so the two people added the plot to the platform jumping game (there is a slight drama below): the main character is a little girl named Madeline, who came to the game alone and named “blue” ”She is suffering from mild depression, so she wants to cure herself by climbing. In this dangerous journey, Madeline will encounter all kinds of roles, non human roles, and even face the dark side of her heart. Although the transition plot in the game only accounts for a small part, most of the time, the game will highlight the mood of the protagonist through various mechanism settings. It has a style of stream of consciousness, which is not very delicate in itself. With the last plot that needs the player’s heart to experience, it forms a rather abstract overall style. Most of the time, the game needs to show the player Da’s emotions are difficult to express even after players have played.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In the invisible platform of flying, how can blue keep pace with many 3A/46cfbfe5638e4e6a88c8ada6e5947c10.jpg" alt="In the invisible platform of flying, how can blue keep pace with many 3A"><br>Fight with your dark side</p>
<h1 id="invisible-platform"><a href="#invisible-platform" class="headerlink" title="invisible platform"></a>invisible platform</h1><p>For a long time, the number of famous adventure games using platform jumping as the main playing method is not large. I vaguely remember that the last one I saw was Xi, an independent game made by Chinese people. Unlike other platform jumping games, most of the players in the game process of blue are in the air rather than on the ground. In the past platform jump games, there is usually a mechanism: the protagonist of the game can only jump in a single period, rarely two-stage jump, but for platform jump games, two-stage jump is a good and bad setting. Although it can make the player’s action more flexible, it is easy to reduce the difficulty of the game, especially for some games with For the works of deciphering elements, it will undoubtedly make developers bother to design “invalidation” of the level setting, so in order to avoid this problem, although the game contains two-stage jump, it can only be triggered under certain conditions, such as the pink enemy in “teacup head” and the lantern in “Xi”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In the invisible platform of flying, how can blue keep pace with many 3A/034c9eee584944e9a49026c769b423b5.jpg" alt="In the invisible platform of flying, how can blue keep pace with many 3A"><br>Xi<br>But “blue” added the mechanism of “sprint” in an ingenious way. The player can realize the short-term and rapid displacement in eight directions in the air, which enables the player to decide when to trigger the effect similar to the two-stage jump. Players can only use sprint once in the air and recover after landing. Sometimes players can refresh the sprint effect in the air by touching the “light ball”, so as to achieve the effect of “multi jump” to cross many impossible environments. Some people may ask if this is not the same as the effect of multi jump in peacetime? Isn’t that meaningless? After playing or watching this game, you will find that almost all the scenes in the game are designed around the unique mechanism of blue. In order to maximize the effect of this mechanism, there is a situation that “most of the time is in the air rather than on the ground”. You can regard the position of each sprint as an “invisible” situation And this point is more obvious in the later stage of high difficulty.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In the invisible platform of flying, how can blue keep pace with many 3A/75d4a3f0299f41198d31772bd6ba5966.jpg" alt="In the invisible platform of flying, how can blue keep pace with many 3A"><br>There will be fewer and fewer footholds until there is no<br>    concluding remarks<br>Excellent operation handle and mechanism, integrated soundtrack, and quite stream of consciousness plot make this game successful, making it the first full score game in 2018. Relying on the creativity of the producer in design, this game type that has not been favored for many years has been reborn. But the author never said that this game is worth everyone’s experience. Even if it’s excellent, it’s still a very difficult platform jumping game, which is not suitable for everyone. It’s only suitable for the players who have certain confidence in their own operation technology. Although there’s a mindless “auxiliary mode” in the game, it will undoubtedly reduce the fun of the game by more than half.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In the invisible platform of flying, how can blue keep pace with many 3A/20c34a6b67934e95a2aa656ab6ae683e.jpg" alt="In the invisible platform of flying, how can blue keep pace with many 3A"><br>It’s worth mentioning that Matt, the game producer, is also a Nintendo fan. He also made many Mario maps with “blue wind” in “Super Mario manufacturing 2”. Interested players can try it.</p>

    <title>In the era of big data, do you want to be a watchdog or a monkey</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/In%20the%20era%20of%20big%20data,%20do%20you%20want%20to%20be%20a%20watchdog%20or%20a%20monkey/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>With the rapid development of science and technology, people’s lives become more efficient and convenient relying on a variety of high-tech digital products. Basically, everyone will have a virtual file on the Internet to use the functions of various service-oriented software. The world’s leading management consulting company once said that: data has penetrated into every industry and business function field and become an important production factor. People’s mining and application of massive data indicates the arrival of a new wave of productivity growth and consumer surplus, and this wave is known as the “big data era”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In the era of big data, do you want to be a watchdog or a monkey/c7e8df4f148a4277bc675f404e4d8d24.jpg" alt="In the era of big data, do you want to be a watchdog or a monkey"><br>But have you ever thought that in such an era, our personal information can still be safe and confidential? Not only have you ever had the experience of adding a shopping cart when you see the desired product on the Internet, but also when you hesitate to buy it, and then you turn off the web page and open other apps, resulting in a huge advertisement in front of you, which is the product you just added to the shopping cart. Or they often receive calls from people who don’t know where they are from, and the content of these calls is often to promote products or businesses. I don’t know if you think like this: how do they know my information? In view of this situation, many artists have expressed their opinions and understandings in different forms, among which, of course, games are indispensable.</p>
<h1 id="“primate-watch-club”"><a href="#“primate-watch-club”" class="headerlink" title="“primate watch club”"></a>“primate watch club”</h1><p>In October 2018, a game development team from Spain, fictiorama studios, brought us a game called do not feed the monkeys. At first glance, anyone who listens to the game with a very strange name will think it is a simulated nurturing game. However, the actual content and playing method of the game are very bad. First of all, we can be sure that there are no monkeys in this game, but when you have a deep understanding of this game, you will have a feeling of “it seems that it’s OK to call it this way”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In the era of big data, do you want to be a watchdog or a monkey/908247ad70d948419d145a5969d36e39.jpg" alt="In the era of big data, do you want to be a watchdog or a monkey"><br>What kind of game is this? I don’t know how to define it. According to the introduction of the game, he calls himself “peeping Simulator”. In the game, the player will play the role of an ordinary citizen living in a rental apartment. A netizen invited the protagonist to join a private club. The activity content of the club is to observe people or things from all over the world through a variety of security cameras or webcams through a software. The club calls each monitoring window “cage”, while the people in the monitoring room are It is called “primate”, that is, “monkey”. There are two rules in the club: no interaction with primates and no feeding of monkeys. In short, the club gives you the right to peek at others, but you must not directly contact with the people under surveillance or send things to the people under surveillance.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In the era of big data, do you want to be a watchdog or a monkey/96b16ed0e8f4450f888b815f949a4793.jpg" alt="In the era of big data, do you want to be a watchdog or a monkey"><br>The so-called “the unreachable are always in turmoil” is that under such a condition, people will be more curious about what will happen if they contact with “monkeys”. In the game, players need to work to maintain their own livelihood. It is necessary to eat and sleep. Next, sitting in front of the computer and watching “monkey”. We can collect some information through the words of “monkey”. By integrating these information and searching on the Internet, we can find out who the observed people are, what they are doing and what secrets they have. With the information in our hands, we can easily accomplish certain things, such as we can threaten some people who do things harmful to the nature to make profits, or help some people who have difficulties and need help, but this means that we, as a stranger, interfere with other people’s original life, and we need to remember to abide by the rules of the club, or we will play over.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In the era of big data, do you want to be a watchdog or a monkey/6545a20524584959a62d12b0245ef782.jpg" alt="In the era of big data, do you want to be a watchdog or a monkey"><br>Everyone has a secret. For example, this politician is a polite politician in the daytime, and he becomes a woman in the middle of the night<br>The mode of the whole game is very similar to the movie “the back window”, which was released on August 1, 1954. The protagonist of the movie spies and collects information every day to detect a murder. The same is true in “don’t feed the monkey”. However, each “cage” does not interfere with each other, but most cages have some strange time If it happens, players can track it if they are interested, and if they don’t do anything, it won’t have any impact. The idea of the game is to give the player the right to choose all things, and let the player know and judge by himself. There is no doubt that peeping into other people’s life is a very exciting thing, but more often it is the player’s conscience that is tested.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In the era of big data, do you want to be a watchdog or a monkey/610be8dac204420f95a2e2a0b26e8934.jpg" alt="In the era of big data, do you want to be a watchdog or a monkey"><br>You can buy something for “the man in the cage”, which is “feed the monkey”</p>
<h1 id="“watchdog”"><a href="#“watchdog”" class="headerlink" title="“watchdog”"></a>“watchdog”</h1><p>In March 2018, Britain and the United States reported that a data analysis company called “Cambridge analysis” collected more than 50 million user data through a psychological quiz developed for Facebook platform, and then used the data to control the 2016 US presidential election. This news burst out, immediately triggered social controversy, which means that all people’s daily actions on the Internet are recorded and analyzed. This event makes many people feel creepy, which means that the network environment we usually rely on is not safe.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In the era of big data, do you want to be a watchdog or a monkey/5b6f4492c17d42ecb6aa768472121383.jpg" alt="In the era of big data, do you want to be a watchdog or a monkey"><br>What websites to watch, what to like and whether to fast forward videos will become the data of character judgment<br>In the game “watchdog”, we have built a world of big data era for us. In order to enjoy the convenient life conveniently and quickly, all people’s information has been uploaded to the same network CTOs, which means that if the system is not secure, everyone’s life will be snooped and controlled, and people’s information will be commercialized for profit ; and if the network administrator is malicious, the same situation will happen. Everyone is in a state of being monitored, with no privacy or freedom to speak of.<br>In the game, we can see that, in fact, people’s life has become more relaxed and convenient because of CTOs, but it seems that the whole city has no vitality and vitality to speak of. You can’t feel the happy atmosphere because of the convenient life. For these citizens who don’t understand, it seems that they deserve it.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In the era of big data, do you want to be a watchdog or a monkey/14536c8c28ad4e81bab19acff9267b5c.jpg" alt="In the era of big data, do you want to be a watchdog or a monkey"><br>With the help of the hacker organization dedsec, the protagonist of the game achieves his own goal, while the darkest part of CTOs is exposed in front of people. People protested and tried to find relevant departments for a statement. From here we can see that the citizens have been kept in the dark for a long time. Although we know that the original intention of CTOs is good, and its purpose is to serve people’s lives, it is inevitable that there will be some outlaws making profits from it.<br>The name of the game is watch dog, which is a proper term in computer science. It refers to a unit used to supervise the chip situation of computer single-chip microcomputer. The city in the game is like a huge single-chip microcomputer, and the hacker organization is like this “watch dog”. It is their existence that makes people realize that information is big The drawback of unity. Even the managers of the world need a watcher to pay attention to them. Otherwise, if they commit crimes that day, who can stop them?<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In the era of big data, do you want to be a watchdog or a monkey/9765508d75c845439347d1afefd2619d.jpg" alt="In the era of big data, do you want to be a watchdog or a monkey"><br>    concluding remarks<br>From different games, we can know the experience and mentality of “Observer” and “observed” from different perspectives. After comparing with reality, we can easily come to the conclusion that the era of big data is like a double-edged sword. While bringing us great convenience in production and life, some seemingly inadvertent things are slowly changing us Life. Since technology is advancing, people’s thoughts and consciousness should also be improved. To change people’s way of controlling new technology, we should learn to think. In a rapidly changing society, we should master our own cognition, do a good job in privacy protection, and never become a naked “transparent person” in front of data.</p>

    <title>In just four months, the fans of Baoke dream have gone from great joy to rage</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/In%20just%20four%20months,%20the%20fans%20of%20Baoke%20dream%20have%20gone%20from%20great%20joy%20to%20rage/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>On February 27, this year, Nintendo announced the eighth generation of its original sequel, baokemeng: Sword / shield, at the new baokemeng face-to-face meeting, which coincided with the 23rd birthday of baokemeng. In this day of universal celebration, players cheer for the release of the new work and celebrate the birth of Baoke dream in different ways. As we all know, there are few people around the world who don’t know the divine IP of “Baoke dream”. Even if they haven’t played games, they also know what kind of creature “picassu” is, which is enough to prove its influence.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In just four months, the fans of Baoke dream have gone from great joy to rage/0664a0f4fc65494997c0be535a94e76f.jpg" alt="In just four months, the fans of Baoke dream have gone from great joy to rage"><br>However, just four months later, the players who used to shout to buy the game have launched a protest against Gamefreak, the developer of the game. The reason is that at the E3 game exhibition just concluded a few days ago, Shunyi Zenda, the game producer of baokemeng series, carefully made a decision that made all fans of baokemeng sad at the E3 face-to-face meeting: only use the new regional atlas in the new work, and any baokemeng not appearing in the atlas can not be transmitted into the game through Pokemon home.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In just four months, the fans of Baoke dream have gone from great joy to rage/cdc3164107324f058e189aa1266f6756.jpg" alt="In just four months, the fans of Baoke dream have gone from great joy to rage"><br>The atmosphere at the scene was once very awkward</p>
<h1 id="“it’s-really-yours-Gamefreak”"><a href="#“it’s-really-yours-Gamefreak”" class="headerlink" title="“it’s really yours, Gamefreak”"></a>“it’s really yours, Gamefreak”</h1><p>What does this decision mean? Pokemon home is Nintendo’s online baokemeng storage service for the “fairy baokemeng” series. With this service, players can take baokemeng from one platform and store it in Pokemon home, and then transfer it to another platform through data conversion. In this way, the transmission of baokemeng can be realized across games and platforms. Their favorite baokemeng Can also accompany the player all the time.<br>However, this function is based on the premise that the transmitted game contains the data of Baoke dream. If “Baoke dream that does not appear in the book cannot be transmitted” as mentioned above, it means that the number of Baoke dream appearing in the new book will be far less than that in the National Book of Baoke dream world. The official said that in the new work, there will only be new baokemeng in the new area and some old baokemeng after selection. The total number may not exceed 400. In fact, there are more than 800 baokemeng in the new work, and more than half of them have been cut down directly and vividly, which is commonly known as “dating”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In just four months, the fans of Baoke dream have gone from great joy to rage/82f93a9fec1b4b63a93d70d90147182d.jpg" alt="In just four months, the fans of Baoke dream have gone from great joy to rage"><br>At first, the service was called Pokemon bank, while Pokemon home was a customized service for new works<br>At first, fans of baokemeng discussed on the eve of E3 how game Freak (GF for short) should adjust its balance against a large number of baokemeng. After all, the game is still dominated by confrontation. In the future, it will be very difficult for all baokemeng’s works to come on stage. Meanwhile, it will also cancel the previous feature system Mega evolution and Z skills. At first, the existence of mega evolution and Z skills is to make up for the imbalance of baokemeng’s ability caused by the large size of the game. This is good. The problem of balance has been solved. The previous solution used to solve balance has also been solved.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In just four months, the fans of Baoke dream have gone from great joy to rage/55bb554664c5478ba0bc1f605547071f.jpg" alt="In just four months, the fans of Baoke dream have gone from great joy to rage"><br>The flamethrower dragon with two kinds of mega evolution has always been favored by players<br>All the old players in the baokemeng series should know that this is not the first “era break” of the baokemeng game. As early as 2002, the fairy baokemeng: ruby / sapphire, which was released with the GBA handheld platform, also had such a situation. Due to the early and technical reasons, there is no way to transfer the data from the previous Gameboy platform to GBA platform, and there is no way to obtain these gems in red / sapphire.<br>This event directly led to the intuitive impact on the sales volume of the game, and the players expressed that they could not accept it. If there is no way to obtain these treasure dreams, then they would not buy them. GF seems to have planned for a long time. After the launch of red / sapphire, it re engraved “baokemeng: Red / green” on GB to GBA, and “baokemeng: Gold / silver” on GBC platform to downward compatible NDS, which solved the problem of “generation separation”. After the problem is solved, players will naturally be “really fragrant”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In just four months, the fans of Baoke dream have gone from great joy to rage/2a368f5b2a444d97b017bbec1eb8d09f.jpg" alt="In just four months, the fans of Baoke dream have gone from great joy to rage"><br>Baoke dream: the ultimate ruby / original sapphire, which was remade on the 3DS platform, is my favorite<br>As a reproduction of “baokemeng: Huang”, a GB platform, baokemeng: let’s go Pikachu / IBU, which was launched a year ago, has also been criticized by players. But in GF’s view, this work is to attract new players who enter the pit due to mobile game “baokemeng go”. No matter in system or setting, it has the same points with mobile game. The deletion and simplification should be simplified. Old players are not willing to admit that this is an orthodox sequel, only use it as an “external” work for publicity purposes, so how much of it can still be received. In this case, it’s terrifying that this work can easily achieve sales of tens of millions of levels, which also improves the sales volume of NS hosts.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In just four months, the fans of Baoke dream have gone from great joy to rage/24747fdc508b49a6b78b8507b9a19c84.jpg" alt="In just four months, the fans of Baoke dream have gone from great joy to rage"><br>The setting of new works is more inclined to new players who have never been exposed to orthodox works</p>
<h1 id="pour-out-anger"><a href="#pour-out-anger" class="headerlink" title="pour out anger"></a>pour out anger</h1><p>After Nintendo treehouse’s baokemeng demonstration (treehouse is the name of Nintendo’s North American Department) was released on the Internet during E3, the players were not optimistic about the game at one time, and the number of clicks was several times as much as the number of likes, and this video also once became the demonstration video with the most clicks during E3.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In just four months, the fans of Baoke dream have gone from great joy to rage/12aa331ebb5c4f6982b6edb1eaabdb7c.jpg" alt="In just four months, the fans of Baoke dream have gone from great joy to rage"><br>Ranking of the number of video games “trodden” at E3 in 2019<br>In response to the players’ protest, GF naturally also needs to explain, but they have come up with one of the most unconvincing reasons: 1. The development of baokemeng on the NS platform will increase the development cost; 2. Time is limited and it is impossible to estimate the balance and quality of too many baokemeng.<br>This is a word that ignites the anger of fans. Why? If you’re a big fan of the Baoke dream series, you should know the rumor: Nintendo has tried to provide technical support for GF many times, but it was rejected by GF. We don’t know the truth of this rumor. What we can know is that GF, who holds the world’s first IP development right, naturally doesn’t need to worry about money. After all, it’s tens of millions of sales, so the claim of development cost doesn’t hold at all. Since money doesn’t want to spend money to improve technical and human resources, that’s the company’s own problem, so the second one is The law is not established.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In just four months, the fans of Baoke dream have gone from great joy to rage/b5e41a1613bd4fac8a561effd6c4d417.jpg" alt="In just four months, the fans of Baoke dream have gone from great joy to rage"><br>Players spontaneously launched the topic of “bringing back national DEX” on the Internet, which led to the participation of online games. At the same time, players reviled gf’s incompetence and begged GF to complete Baoke’s dream, even if the game was released later.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In just four months, the fans of Baoke dream have gone from great joy to rage/dd1b77ded6224285b1a8b0b3ad8bb5d7.jpg" alt="In just four months, the fans of Baoke dream have gone from great joy to rage"><br>And so forth<br>Recently, a netizen made such a comment:<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In just four months, the fans of Baoke dream have gone from great joy to rage/aefe4093328a47cc895d8296552903bc.jpg" alt="In just four months, the fans of Baoke dream have gone from great joy to rage"><br>In other words, it takes five minutes to model a Baoke dream, while it only takes 60 hours for 800 Baoke dreams to express their dissatisfaction with GF. In response to this speech, many players said that they “don’t have back pain when standing and talking”, “you can go up” cloud cloud cloud, but also capable players said that five minutes is really enough, they have to try and publish their works on the Internet.<br>Most of these works are in the style of abstractionism, but there is no lack of gods coming out to show decent things. No matter what the quality of the works is, they are all venting their dissatisfaction to GF. In the face of waves of players’ protests, GF seems to be disappearing without giving a response, but in this way, at least, they avoid reactivating the contradiction.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In just four months, the fans of Baoke dream have gone from great joy to rage/b6f74149ec63445a8897bb4276a5cf99.jpg" alt="In just four months, the fans of Baoke dream have gone from great joy to rage"><br>The creations of the players are various, and they have been used for more than 5 minutes<br>    concluding remarks<br>I have a loyal fan of “Baoke dream” series around me. He can’t accept gf’s decision. At first, he was also immersed in the joy of the new work’s release like other Baoke dream fans. Earlier, he even couldn’t get to sleep because the game trailer didn’t announce the release date. Now, he even has the idea of buying second-hand products so as not to contribute to gf’s sales Before the formation of a strong contrast. Most fans hold the same idea, and plan to let the sales volume of the new work die suddenly, which will make GF suffer a little. In my opinion, these are meaningless actions, and what should be bought will still be bought at that time.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In just four months, the fans of Baoke dream have gone from great joy to rage/fac8a387a8fb409eb8025c62138d251c.jpg" alt="In just four months, the fans of Baoke dream have gone from great joy to rage"><br>We don’t know how to plan and view the IP within GF, but it seems that the voice of players can’t shake its decision. I remember that GF has been insisting on making baokemeng become the real partner of players for many years, not just a series of cold data. Now in the new work, we may not even see baokemeng, who once took risks with us. How can we say that? I hope GF can respond to the call of players. If we continue to shut up like this, even the “God IP” will fall to the altar one day.</p>

    <title>In order to play the game quickly and happily, the game manufacturers do a lot of homework</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/In%20order%20to%20play%20the%20game%20quickly%20and%20happily,%20the%20game%20manufacturers%20do%20a%20lot%20of%20homework/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>How to define a game “not fun”? Maybe it’s the lack of unity in the overall rhythm of the game, or the poor plot and depth of the game, or it’s possible to dissuade from the complex and awkward operation just after contact, or it’s lucky that the game is too hard core and can’t be accepted by most people.<br>The first impression that a game brings to the players is particularly important. If the operation, difficulty or even game system is not satisfactory, then the players will naturally have negative feelings for the game when they haven’t touched the content in the middle and later period, let alone want to keep the players for a long time.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In order to play the game quickly and happily, the game manufacturers do a lot of homework/13a70e641f1f4307a30c1ac000b88f14.jpg" alt="In order to play the game quickly and happily, the game manufacturers do a lot of homework"><br>I believe that the players who first contact with “soul” series are desperate when they see boss, the blood bar that breaks through the sky<br>The author has always held a view that if a game makes people feel uncomfortable to play, then no matter how good the game is, it will not bring pleasure to the players. It is not only the first impression, but also the pleasure and satisfaction for the players under the limited conditions and scope for the single game type. Otherwise, the above situation will also occur. Of course, as game developers, they naturally see these problems more thoroughly than we do, and they are also thinking about how to do it to please the players. In view of the above problems, developers have made great efforts in places we didn’t pay attention to, and when we see these contents alone, they will feel suddenly enlightened.</p>
<h1 id="“bright-and-dark”-guidance"><a href="#“bright-and-dark”-guidance" class="headerlink" title="“bright and dark” guidance"></a>“bright and dark” guidance</h1><p>No matter in what game, novice tutorial is one of the absolutely indispensable elements. Good novice guidance will directly affect the first impression of players. There are more than 100 kinds of games on the market, and there will be different types of novice tutorials. Considering that not all players are cute and new, there are no fewer experienced players. For different groups, the scale of novice tutorials also needs to be taken into consideration.<br>For budding new players, they need to get a lot of information about the game content through the tutorial at the beginning of the game. These content is not just to plug the players directly at the beginning of the game. A large number of words and pictures will only make the players bored. For players with experience in the game, when the basic operation is completely self-evident, these players or Xu only needs deep system guidance. These contents can appear at the right time with the promotion of the game, or they can directly give players the opportunity to experience in the early stage.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In order to play the game quickly and happily, the game manufacturers do a lot of homework/0a9fad668fe64fdbaef45f9c6949d1a9.jpg" alt="In order to play the game quickly and happily, the game manufacturers do a lot of homework"><br>The operation of csgo is only simple to move, jump, squat and shoot, but the deep level operation needs to be explored by itself<br>There is an extreme way, which is to restrict the operation of the players. The full name leads the players. Naturally, the game process can be pushed forward normally, and the problem that the players can’t operate can be avoided. But this feeling is like feeding children to eat, eating is eating, and can’t eat out, so it’s not said that the children won’t eat by themselves until they have finished eating.<br>The same is true of games. This phenomenon often occurs in mobile games and web games. In the first ten minutes of the game, the players basically have no right to choose and control. They can only follow the course step by step. Even the game settings are not allowed to be changed in the middle of the course. When the course is really over, the players’ cognition of the game content is still half understood and cannot be fully remembered. I believe that The players who have been exposed to the game will be more or less repelled by the design.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In order to play the game quickly and happily, the game manufacturers do a lot of homework/3994a165e54d4311aa79ebfad616760c.jpg" alt="In order to play the game quickly and happily, the game manufacturers do a lot of homework"><br>It’s convenient and fast to find the way automatically, but it’s hard to remember the layout of the map once you leave this system<br>Too much guidance of the game will directly affect the game experience, and too much obscurity will make the players feel brainless. It is also necessary to make adjustments in this regard for different game types. So what kind of guidance is effective without affecting the game experience? Take the PS4 exclusive game “mysterious sea area” series as an example. The protagonist seldom has a single activity, usually accompanied by an NPC. In the first chapter of “mysterious sea area 4”, the player should control the young protagonist to follow his brother’s steps and start to take risks. The player can also try the same way on how his brother climbs, jumps, uses props and looks for roads.<br>The so-called “imitation” is a kind of instinct of human beings. It not only gives simple and intuitive guidance to the players, but also connects the development of the plot of the game. “Imitation” means that the players’ ability of “learning” can be exerted involuntarily. It feels like growing up together with the protagonist, and it can also improve the sense of game substitution, which must be said to be a brilliant design.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In order to play the game quickly and happily, the game manufacturers do a lot of homework/955b90a65a4143318cb8b4e713b17bcd.jpg" alt="In order to play the game quickly and happily, the game manufacturers do a lot of homework"><br>The whole chapter is the novice course of the game, the first half is to learn how to operate, the second half is to practice alone<br>There are many ways to guide the game, mostly using psychological and visual cues, such as highlighting an object in the game with a sharp color difference, or warning the player in advance, etc. a good guide needs to predict and simulate the behavior of the player from the beginning of creation, so as to complete the process design of the whole game. There are still many doorways in it, which will not be described here for the moment.</p>
<p>#It doesn’t matter. Just be handsome<br>So after the player has guidance, how to continuously satisfy the player’s “careful thinking” is the added homework to be done. We play action games in order to experience the vigorous fighting, speed games in order to experience the speed of speed, adventure games in order to experience the mysterious and unknown exploration, etc. regardless of the type, players are always pursuing the pure “satisfaction”, stripping out other elements of the game except the core, only strengthening the experience of the core content, then the overall The effect will be improved one level.<br>What does that mean? Do you think that the more you play action games, the more close you are to death, the stronger and more resistant your character will be? Do you feel more and more close to the car in front of you when you play the racing game and you don’t want to win? This is not a psychological illusion, but the intention of developers.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In order to play the game quickly and happily, the game manufacturers do a lot of homework/801ec519d0a84db897f2108dd9342cc2.jpg" alt="In order to play the game quickly and happily, the game manufacturers do a lot of homework"><br>The last few squares of blood will be extra thick, especially in the assassin’s Creed<br>A more intuitive example is the Mario Kart series. The lower ranked players are more likely to get powerful props to give more opportunities to overtake, while the top ranked players can only get some auxiliary props such as banana peel and accelerator.<br>In many other racing games, there is usually a mechanism called “rubber banding”, which is also called “car chasing” in the game. Simply speaking, backward vehicles will inadvertently obtain the performance similar to driving a “rocket hitch”, which makes it easier to catch up with the vehicles ahead. In this way, you can always create a kind of continuous development The illusion of chasing me, which can stimulate the adrenaline of players and improve the experience of racing games.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In order to play the game quickly and happily, the game manufacturers do a lot of homework/088db6f46a324536b2c79a48ee8b7433.jpg" alt="In order to play the game quickly and happily, the game manufacturers do a lot of homework"><br>The “rocket hitch” with the sudden acceleration of the rear car was originally born from the series of “the best flying car”<br>Another example that has to be mentioned is action games and fighting games. In these games, there are many kinds of attacks with different styles, such as Dante’s continuous stabbing in “ghost cry”, “Kratos’s” big windmill “in” ares “, and many characters in” Nintendo star fights “have kicking skills. These skills look like” olaolaolao “ Pull “is gorgeous several times at a time, but in fact, its operation is very simple. It can be easily rubbed out. Maybe the damage of these moves is not high, but players like to use them, because these skills will give people the illusion that” I’ve hit so many times, the damage must be very high “or” I can hit you to fly is I’m more powerful “, which is the illusion In order to achieve endless “pleasure” for the players in the game, let alone whether they play well. If the players feel that they are “really handsome” in the game, they can be encouraged to play all the time.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In order to play the game quickly and happily, the game manufacturers do a lot of homework/7350210b379c464b96d1ab14d1a9ffa9.jpg" alt="In order to play the game quickly and happily, the game manufacturers do a lot of homework"><br>Kuiye’s “big windmill” did not hurt very much, but in the early stage, everyone couldn’t let it go<br>    concluding remarks<br>Making a game is not as simple as we think. Every piece of content we hear and see in the game is actually the effort of developers. From beautiful pictures, moving music and other intuitive elements, we can feel them naturally, and these hidden contents in the dark side are not painstaking design.<br>It’s not hard to make a game, but it’s really hard to make a good game. Sometimes, from the perspective of developers, we can re-examine these games that we have cursory clearance. The content that has not been noticed can highlight the good intentions of developers, which makes people have to worship and respect them.</p>

    <title>In the war, not everyone is a fighter, not interesting but can&#39;t stop our war</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/In%20the%20war,%20not%20everyone%20is%20a%20fighter,%20not%20interesting%20but%20can&#39;t%20stop%20our%20war/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>War, which is not a rare subject in the field of games, we can play a cavalry soldier in battlefield, a brave and skillful military driver in thunder of war, or a strategist commander in the division of steel. No matter which, the core is to let players experience the joy of victory in the war Yue. Have you ever thought about how the civilians outside the conflict suffered during the war. They have no military like will and physical strength, and can only watch their hometown and people around them turn into dust in the smoke of gunpowder. No one wants to die in vain. They want to live, so they need to do everything to survive. And this is the story of our war, in which you play the role of civilians.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In the war, not everyone is a fighter, not interesting but can't stop our war/da5c316a5ba54ee5ac6e3a4cfec35e4c.jpg" alt="In the war, not everyone is a fighter, not interesting but can&#39;t stop our war"></p>
<p>#Angle drilling<br>“The war of mine”, also known as “this is my war”, is a horizontal version of survival theme game produced by 11 bit studio, a Polish game developer. Because of its many elements, it is difficult to directly define what kind of game it is. As mentioned above, the background of the game is set in a modern aerial war. Players need to play the role of civilians in the city surrounded by the war, try their best to survive, add facilities, make tools and food, repair loopholes, etc. for the shelter during the day, and do a series of preparations to deal with various situations At night, survivors can be sent out to search for materials and supplies. The highlight of the game is to explore at night. After all, it is impossible for the whole city to have only the survivors under the control of the players, so the players can meet other survivors in other areas. They have good and evil, strong and weak, different camps have different personalities and styles, so there will be different encounters and events. How to deal with these people is up to the players themselves.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In the war, not everyone is a fighter, not interesting but can't stop our war/0eb26eb75d5649c8896672973ae2c9ef.jpg" alt="In the war, not everyone is a fighter, not interesting but can&#39;t stop our war"><br>The core of the game is to maintain the hunger, life and mood of the survivors in our camp, and persist until the end of the war. On the whole, in view of the special theme, the atmosphere of the game is always surrounded by the two emotions of “deep pain” and “Sadness”, so it is difficult for players to have positive emotions when playing this game. Compared with survival, the game is more difficult to “choose”, and these choices often appear in the dilemma of players. For example, if someone in the player’s camp needs medicine due to illness, ignoring it may lead to the death of the survivor. When going out for exploration, it is found that one of the survivors has the medicine that the player needs, but others also need him. Therefore, how to deal with it requires the player to make his own choice, to leave the medicine empty handed, to trade for medicine, or even Can be more extreme to kill survivors to grab supplies. Such moral choices account for almost half of the content of the game. Under the influence of human nature, most players will put themselves into the game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In the war, not everyone is a fighter, not interesting but can't stop our war/e5deb9984de34875ba0881123c675c54.jpg" alt="In the war, not everyone is a fighter, not interesting but can&#39;t stop our war"></p>
<p>#The crime of buying money?<br>The difficulty of survival games always depends on the overall rhythm of the game. In such games as famine and my world, players usually only need two days in the game to meet the basic needs of survival, so as to be ready to experience the following content. In “our war”, players can’t easily relax their vigilance even in the end. There will never be too many materials, and they can hardly survive the war smoothly. In the game, taking days as the unit is regarded as the process progress of the game, and the activity time of players in each day is extremely limited, it seems that they are always in a state of competing against time. In the process of going out to explore, not only the characters do not know the situation of the target area, but also the players themselves do not know. Due to the limited time and portable resources, it is difficult for the players to master the whole area in one exploration, and even to find out what resources and personnel are in the scene. This requires the players to go to the same place for exploration many times, and to master a place All the designs of the area can be explored more efficiently.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In the war, not everyone is a fighter, not interesting but can't stop our war/52fcabc190ca4e678d3617a78ee018b9.jpg" alt="In the war, not everyone is a fighter, not interesting but can&#39;t stop our war"><br>The system setting of the game is far more than that. Although the game itself is not a pseudo real work, it restores the most likely things in reality as much as possible. It is also the case in the above article. Different choices not only test the morality of playing AKI, but also affect the mood of NPC and players. If they do something bad, they will panic and blame themselves. Materials If they are not enough, they will be depressed and so on. These situations will turn the character’s mood into negative, and at the same time affect the character’s value. If the player wants to survive as much as possible, the primary goal is to meet the character’s needs as much as possible. Careful players should not find it hard to find that the characters in the game almost ignore the gain state, and can only make up for the needs of some aspects through the character’s specialty. In most cases, the types and frequency of the reduced benefit state can even subvert the players’ cognition.<br>In short, the overall difficulty of the game and the system design are very inhumane, so the difficulty of starting the game is also on the high side. The dark atmosphere of the game itself, combined with these “unsatisfactory” settings, is very difficult for players to find fun in this game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In the war, not everyone is a fighter, not interesting but can't stop our war/6fd05ba4b87f45dd9ce8f0ffdde1de22.jpg" alt="In the war, not everyone is a fighter, not interesting but can&#39;t stop our war"></p>
<p>#The aftertaste is endless<br>According to 11bit studio, the developer of the game, the inspiration for the creation of this work comes from the longest siege campaign in the history of modern war, the siege of Sarajevo in the civil war of Yugoslavia, which lasted from 1992 to 1996. During this period, the residents of the city were often slaughtered, and tanks and artillery often bombed the city. There are about 5500 civilians in total Unfortunately, he lost his life in the battle. Bit’s idea of creating the game is to reflect on the war. The official said: “it’s time for the game to start exploring important issues like other art forms.”.<br>The author may be able to understand that they want to express their anti war mentality as much as possible. Many unfriendly system designs in the game are the cruel means for developers to express the war. Developers make full use of one of the characteristics of players to pull players into the scene they want to construct, that is human nature. After careful observation, it is not difficult to find that the reason why the players’ camp is set to be multi player in the game is to highlight the concept that “under a disaster, only a concerted effort can overcome the difficulty”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In the war, not everyone is a fighter, not interesting but can't stop our war/26c8ccc691dc44c5acafbabac485cee3.jpg" alt="In the war, not everyone is a fighter, not interesting but can&#39;t stop our war"><br>We can reverse our thinking. Most of the players in the game camp are good people with good hearts. Although it’s easy to be a bad person, it also needs to pay a certain price. If there is good, there is evil. So why don’t there be a few characters with the concept of “I can do anything to survive”? In that way, even if you do something bad, you will not be condemned by your conscience. Players can seize other people’s goods and even kill innocent people carefree to maximize their own interests.<br>It’s undeniable that this is the real situation in reality, but 11 bit, which strives to restore the real situation, fails to make these contents into the game, because if it does, it will be devastating to the atmosphere created by the game, which will undoubtedly reduce the difficulty of the game, so that the players will not feel the cruelty of the war. Bit obviously has a relatively excessive pursuit of the “art” they envision. Although it may cause the player’s antipathy, in their eyes, the artistry of the game needs to be expressed is far greater than the fun of playing the game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In the war, not everyone is a fighter, not interesting but can't stop our war/0a983a16c50b45ec953394989b28bd46.jpg" alt="In the war, not everyone is a fighter, not interesting but can&#39;t stop our war"></p>
<p>#Conclusion<br>There is no doubt that “our war” is a very novel theme and excellent quality game work, but it can’t be called “interesting”. It can bring unprecedented emotion and experience to the players. Although the degree is far less than the impact of real war on people, it has been quite outstanding as a media work.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/In the war, not everyone is a fighter, not interesting but can't stop our war/d6ae6fd36d0c4dd399d441396969e8d2.jpg" alt="In the war, not everyone is a fighter, not interesting but can&#39;t stop our war"><br>Many of the bridge sections in the game are hard to forget after playing. For example, the two old people in the mansion, such as the woman who was invaded by the soldiers, and so on. It is precisely because we brought ourselves into the game that these ordinary things in the relevant works usually seem to be very popular. This is a masterpiece that is worth everyone’s experience. In my opinion, it is not a good game, for example, it is a “war survival manual” that can be experienced in real life.</p>

    <title>Infinite evolution and self playing RTS reborn by new playing method, war art standing on giant&#39;s shoulder</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/Infinite%20evolution%20and%20self%20playing%20RTS%20reborn%20by%20new%20playing%20method,%20war%20art%20standing%20on%20giant&#39;s%20shoulder/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>For science fiction works, I always want to give up, whether it’s movies or games, I like it very much. Although this theme is small in China, it doesn’t affect its own unique charm at all. But there is only one kind of game that makes me feel helpless most, that is, real-time strategy (RTs). Although I like games very much, RTS is like a black hole for me, especially in the face of science fiction RTS, I love and hate it very much, such as StarCraft or halo war. I am curious about his plot, but I am suffering from RTs Hand, if I watch the plot flow online and can’t get the experience that I can only get in the game, this once led me into a contradiction.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Infinite evolution and self playing RTS reborn by new playing method, war art standing on giant's shoulder/3bd056bb55de45faa6b9d4b84bc151e2.jpg" alt="Infinite evolution and self playing RTS reborn by new playing method, war art standing on giant&#39;s shoulder"><br>In 2017, an RTS mobile game named “war Art: red tide” appeared on the market. The logo design is very good, and the painting quality and UI performance are also very good. It is a game made by heart. The evaluation of the game is also good, which is obviously different from a number of domestic gold sucking mobile games. I also paid attention to this game for a while, but it’s a pity that RTS is a cold type after all. Even if we get the best reputation, we can’t withstand the impact of time. Then we can get new life by updating the self-propelled chess mode.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Infinite evolution and self playing RTS reborn by new playing method, war art standing on giant's shoulder/5efdbb984e42463fb2e28885b7259d9e.jpg" alt="Infinite evolution and self playing RTS reborn by new playing method, war art standing on giant&#39;s shoulder"><br>The silence is quiet.<br>As we all know, RTS is definitely not a kind of game that makes people feel like a model for players. Works such as Empire era and command and conquest were very popular in the early years, and then there were two leading figures, StarCraft and Warcraft, which were led by blizzard. At that time, these two series almost looked down upon the existence of all beings. RTS has a relatively high standard both in the game system and in the depth of playing methods. If we put aside the technical problems of the game itself, this type of works will rarely have poor quality. However, with high depth comes the high difficulty and high threshold of the game. In addition to some simulation games on the market, perhaps RTS is the game with the most complex operation and the highest requirement for proficiency. Therefore, the learning threshold of the game is also high. If you want to really master this type, you must invest a lot of time in practice. Usually it’s good to play a single game by yourself. If you compete with other players, the technical gap will be more obvious. And if it’s a duel between experts, you will usually fight very hard, consuming a lot of time and physical strength.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Infinite evolution and self playing RTS reborn by new playing method, war art standing on giant's shoulder/6a8c6ed180f7482bbdeb7174d1225c7b.jpg" alt="Infinite evolution and self playing RTS reborn by new playing method, war art standing on giant&#39;s shoulder"><br>Warcraft III<br>High threshold, difficult to have fun, and may not please the effort, which doomed that although this game type is excellent, there will not be too many players insist on playing, as time goes by, this type has become more and more popular and unpopular. There are a group of people who are deeply in love with RTS and always want to bring this excellent game type back to the vision of the players. They have changed their ways to improve and simplify the original RTS, and they have moved it to a more popular mobile platform, so that they can enjoy the game more easily while retaining the strategy. War Art: red tide is one of them Member. Red tide is not the first RTS game on the mobile platform, but it is undoubtedly one of the best works with the most excellent performance, and it is also a domestic product. All players have to do in the game is to match their own arms, and collect resources in the battle and deploy units for the opposite situation. The rest is handled by AI.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Infinite evolution and self playing RTS reborn by new playing method, war art standing on giant's shoulder/c557a0ee45bd402da76aa9cbda25829a.jpg" alt="Infinite evolution and self playing RTS reborn by new playing method, war art standing on giant&#39;s shoulder"><br>     doubts<br>Red tide has become a hot product in stores as soon as it goes online. In 2017, it was even rated as the best game of the year for national iPad by apple. However, with the popularity of the game, the internal dispute of the game gradually began to appear. All arms units and symbols in the game can be obtained through normal games or krypton gold. Obviously, the latter is more efficient and direct, while the former takes a lot of time, so a new phenomenon appears in the game: the gap between free players and krypton gold players is widened by the paid content, and krypton gold players are more and more happy, and free players are more and more happy Dissatisfaction, there is no motivation to work hard, leading to the loss of players. And those krypton gold players who don’t need money can’t have fun in the game, so they naturally choose to turn to other games. It can be said that the game red is instantaneous, and the cool is instantaneous. I didn’t expect that this time RTS is not cool on the threshold, but cool on the dispute between krypton gold players and free players. The sudden situation makes developers feel helpless for a while.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Infinite evolution and self playing RTS reborn by new playing method, war art standing on giant's shoulder/b355a07adb2d49b993433a7d635eee3f.jpg" alt="Infinite evolution and self playing RTS reborn by new playing method, war art standing on giant&#39;s shoulder"><br>It’s also a coincidence that “Dao TA Zi You Qi” born from “dota2” suddenly became a big hit, which inspired “red tide”: the design of “dota2” originated from “Warcraft 3”, and “Warcraft 3” is also an RTS, which has many similarities in mechanism, and the rules of self playing chess have appeared since “Warcraft 3”, so for “red tide” 》It seems that it’s not difficult to add the same pattern. What needs to be done is to adjust the value of the character. Therefore, red tide decided to add the self-propelled chess rule in its own game. “Red tide” has its own unique advantages. The optimization of its own game is implemented in place. The scale of 100 people on the same screen is not a problem. At the same time, “red tide” has game pictures and materials superior to many hand games. These contents can be used directly, and can directly surpass competitors, and preempt others in the market.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Infinite evolution and self playing RTS reborn by new playing method, war art standing on giant's shoulder/20413f29ecec4f75ba56ac64d6076b59.jpg" alt="Infinite evolution and self playing RTS reborn by new playing method, war art standing on giant&#39;s shoulder"></p>
<p>#Do you forget anything?<br>However, the ideal is plump. Compared with other big and powerful game manufacturers, red tide is still a step slower and a little later. However, it is relying on its unique advantages that it attracts more and even more game players than before. The reputation of red tide itself is still good. No matter what, it also took the work of the annual game at the beginning and has a certain reputation Du, and the return of the self-propelled chess mode has undoubtedly attracted more people’s attention. Soon, the heat of the game ranked back in the top ten. As you can see, the official has stepped up the update frequency of the self-propelled chess mode, constantly optimized the value and mechanism, improved the completion of the mode and made the mode more suitable for the mobile platform, shortened the game duration, and the overall game rhythm more close to the fast pace of the mobile platform. In addition to the internal update, the external game publicity work is not idle. The game related events are held in an endless stream. It can be seen that the game authorities have devoted their efforts to it.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Infinite evolution and self playing RTS reborn by new playing method, war art standing on giant's shoulder/6b910d7d3cb14a8d8c2374658980da2f.jpg" alt="Infinite evolution and self playing RTS reborn by new playing method, war art standing on giant&#39;s shoulder"><br>Red tide’s go chess<br>See here, who remember this is an RTS game? The proportion of self-propelled chess in the game is growing, and the game has been renamed “war Art: infinite evolution”, and almost no introduction of RTS mode has been seen in any publicity content. From the appearance, the game has become a thorough self-propelled chess player game. Fortunately, the official didn’t delete the classic RTS mode, but included it in the leisure mode to reduce the sense of existence. The current classic mode has become a dessert for players in addition to playing the self-propelled chess mode. This is very painful for the remaining old players, which means that they gradually forget their existence, until the official show that they will not stop updating the classic mode, which makes the old players slowly breathe a sigh of relief, but still want to immerse in the enthusiasm of those self-propelled players, and do not know when the next update will be It’s hard to avoid feeling bad.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Infinite evolution and self playing RTS reborn by new playing method, war art standing on giant's shoulder/42944690ae624e49a32dab27ba364ce6.jpg" alt="Infinite evolution and self playing RTS reborn by new playing method, war art standing on giant&#39;s shoulder"><br>    concluding remarks<br>I admit, “infinite evolution” is the mobile self-propelled chess game with the highest comprehensive quality that players can play on the market at present. Later, the introduction of role linkage with SNK also brought many surprises to players. As a player, I can understand that the official decision is to adapt to the masses and maintain the vitality of the game, and many old players of RTS mode have done a good job of being replaced. No one can know what the future of infinite evolution will be, but at least for now, it is certain that the game has the qualification to be remembered by the players.</p>

    <title>Infinite evolution of self-propelled chess the art of hand to hand combat, the analysis of the lineup of beast puppets</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/Infinite%20evolution%20of%20self-propelled%20chess%20the%20art%20of%20hand%20to%20hand%20combat,%20the%20analysis%20of%20the%20lineup%20of%20beast%20puppets/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In the infinite evolution of self-propelled chess, when it comes to hand to hand combat, I believe that the first unit you think of is the warrior unit, but in fact, in addition to the warrior, the beast, guard, puppet and other units also have a strong hand to hand combat ability, and each has its own characteristics. The warrior has armor bonus, the beast can bring extra attack speed, and the guard can get a strong shield effect, puppet Puppets can enjoy a high attack bonus.<br>Here, we will bring you a set of analysis of the beast puppet flow lineup, which depends on the powerful output effect of the puppet unit and the total attack speed bonus of the beast flow. In terms of hand combat, the overall output strength is even higher than the warrior flow.</p>
<h1 id="analysis-of-lineup’s-combination-and-collocation"><a href="#analysis-of-lineup’s-combination-and-collocation" class="headerlink" title="analysis of lineup’s combination and collocation"></a>analysis of lineup’s combination and collocation</h1><p>Let’s first look at the core of the lineup system.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Infinite evolution of self-propelled chess the art of hand to hand combat, the analysis of the lineup of beast puppets/1d9fc2a03445428cb71378f8eda347be.jpg" alt="Infinite evolution of self-propelled chess the art of hand to hand combat, the analysis of the lineup of beast puppets"><br>Beast company with:   2 beast increases attack speed of its own beast unit by 10%, 4 beast increases attack speed of all allies by 25%, 6 beast increases attack speed of all allies by 60%.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Infinite evolution of self-propelled chess the art of hand to hand combat, the analysis of the lineup of beast puppets/f648d15827194b32ab18db359be85842.jpg" alt="Infinite evolution of self-propelled chess the art of hand to hand combat, the analysis of the lineup of beast puppets"><br>Puppet company carrying:   2 when puppet, increase the attack power of your puppet unit by 10%, 4 when puppet, increase the attack power of your puppet unit by 30%, 6 when puppet, increase the attack power of all your units by 55%.<br>The attack power and attack speed are the most important output factors for physical output, and the beast and puppet company meet these two points. However, it’s a little pity that the beast and puppet are racial positioning, so there is no beast puppet attribute in the game, so the lineup of 6 beast and 6 puppet is almost impossible in the game To achieve this, however, we need to take the second place. 25% of the attack speed bonus of all 4 beasts and 30% of the attack speed bonus of 4 puppets can already bring enough powerful output to the team. Therefore, the most important point for the beast puppet flow is actually the choice of the core chess pieces.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Infinite evolution of self-propelled chess the art of hand to hand combat, the analysis of the lineup of beast puppets/19e71fb8f7bc43159c2a67159a2d98a0.jpg" alt="Infinite evolution of self-propelled chess the art of hand to hand combat, the analysis of the lineup of beast puppets"><br>Four wild animals match recommendation: giant tooth elephant, ferocious poisonous animal, longevity deer, blood eagle.<br>Two cheap beasts, two expensive beasts. It’s easy for Samsung with low cost, and it’s difficult to start at the early stage. It’s very suitable for filling the role of the current platoon tank. Moreover, both the giant tooth elephant and the fierce poisonous beast are positioned by the beast warrior. They can form a warrior company with the sword slave and the sword slave in the puppet to further improve the combat ability of the lineup. The high star chess pieces recommend to assist the beast longevity deer and the battle core blood eagle to improve the quality of the mid late lineup.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Infinite evolution of self-propelled chess the art of hand to hand combat, the analysis of the lineup of beast puppets/bbaf3feb092747429d3d7f82629e8aa8.jpg" alt="Infinite evolution of self-propelled chess the art of hand to hand combat, the analysis of the lineup of beast puppets"><br>Four puppet match recommendations: Axe slave, sword slave, sword slave, shield slave.<br>The core of the output of the beast puppet flow lies in the two brothers, sword slave and sword slave. The attack speed bonus of the beast company and the attack power bonus of the puppet company serve the two units. Moreover, the two brothers belong to the warrior profession at the same time. Under the bonus of the Warrior armor, they are more powerful in the later period. The other two puppet units recommend axe slave and shield slave. Axe slave has the advantages of low cost and easy access to stars. As an assassin unit, it can directly cut into the enemy’s back row without crowding together. As an output role of AOE in the front row, shield slave can resist and fight, and later two stars can have strong strength.</p>
<h1 id="operation-process-and-actual-combat-details"><a href="#operation-process-and-actual-combat-details" class="headerlink" title="operation process and actual combat details"></a>operation process and actual combat details</h1><p><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Infinite evolution of self-propelled chess the art of hand to hand combat, the analysis of the lineup of beast puppets/0bc9f340affe4135ad4d870229ed7d59.jpg" alt="Infinite evolution of self-propelled chess the art of hand to hand combat, the analysis of the lineup of beast puppets"><br>Early goal: two beasts and three soldiers. The most ideal configuration is giant toothed elephant, fierce poisonous beast and sword slave. The three units can join hands. Although sword slave has been weakened to a certain extent in the near future, it is still a very powerful card from the current actual combat effect. Especially in the early stage, if two-star sword slave can be started early, then the first half of the whole competition will be safe.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Infinite evolution of self-propelled chess the art of hand to hand combat, the analysis of the lineup of beast puppets/507e04a59a3e4e669c333cf34c545253.jpg" alt="Infinite evolution of self-propelled chess the art of hand to hand combat, the analysis of the lineup of beast puppets"><br>Second stage goal: 4 beast 4 puppet 4 warrior.<br>Different from the beast war, the beast puppet flow does not need to pursue the effect of six battles. It uses the beast pieces as the front row of the team and relies on the puppet units for output. However, relatively speaking, the overall strong team of the lineup has a high dependence on the quality of the flags. If we can start with three-star sword slaves or sword slaves, it may be very simple to win in a row and eat chicken. If there are only two-star pieces, Then it may depend on the specific situation of the actual opponent. If there are more than one chess piece on the 8 population field, then it has basically gone far. Therefore, it must be remembered that for the beast puppet flow, the star level of the chess pieces is very important. Don’t pursue the high cost chess pieces too much. Take the low cost as the main combat power, and judge whether you need to search the cards to improve the combat power according to the actual situation of the blood volume.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Infinite evolution of self-propelled chess the art of hand to hand combat, the analysis of the lineup of beast puppets/60cae094d6ea4751a9c491d8669c687a.jpg" alt="Infinite evolution of self-propelled chess the art of hand to hand combat, the analysis of the lineup of beast puppets"><br>In the later stage, it’s the only goal to find Sanxing to eat chicken. We recommend Sanxing as the priority. JianNu = daonu &gt; ferocious beast &gt; others. Swords and slaves are the core of the lineup, and Samsung chess is a strong guarantee to eat chicken. Therefore, in the middle and late stage of the game, Samsung swords will always be the first choice of the lineup system. Secondly, it is recommended to pursue the three-star fierce poison beast. The sword output requires the front row unit to pull space. Therefore, the three-star priority of the giant tooth elephant and the fierce poison beast is also very high. However, the giant tooth elephant’s three-star income is not very large. If the grid is not enough in the later period, two stars can make do with it instead of forcing the three-star, but the fierce poison beast is not the same. The three-star fierce poison beast skill armor reduction effect can be obtained With the improvement of quality and the physical output of sword, it can quickly kill the injured characters in the front row of the enemy, improve the overall output ability of the team in the later stage, which is very obvious, and try to ensure Samsung. However, other units are either not significantly improved, or the cost is too expensive, and later Samsung is more difficult.<br>Compared with the beast war, the beast puppet stream abandoned the high armor bonus of the 6th battle, and turned to pursue the high attack speed of the beast and the high attack power bonus of the puppet. The actual combat effect of the beast puppet is believed to be better when it comes to the output ability of hand to hand combat.</p>

    <title>Infinite evolution and self-propelled chess analysis of the nine warriors&#39; lineup</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/Infinite%20evolution%20and%20self-propelled%20chess%20analysis%20of%20the%20nine%20warriors&#39;%20lineup/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In the infinite evolution of self-propelled chess, there are 10 warrior units in total, and the overall distribution is very balanced, not easy to card hands, which is very suitable for players who like the Mangfu flow.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Infinite evolution and self-propelled chess analysis of the nine warriors' lineup/c445fb8fd031411f82bde97404a0cb58.jpg" alt="Infinite evolution and self-propelled chess analysis of the nine warriors&#39; lineup"><br>In addition, in the game, most of the warrior units give attention to both output and defense, and only by their own strength can they compete with many systems. Here, the nine warrior line-up routine introduced to you is the most simple and direct, but the most powerful, extreme reckless player.</p>
<h1 id="analysis-of-lineup-company"><a href="#analysis-of-lineup-company" class="headerlink" title="analysis of lineup company"></a>analysis of lineup company</h1><p><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Infinite evolution and self-propelled chess analysis of the nine warriors' lineup/750a5e1c8ed34be3862b66773da13b13.jpg" alt="Infinite evolution and self-propelled chess analysis of the nine warriors&#39; lineup"><br>Warrior company carry: Warrior units can get extra armor, 4 extra armor for 3 warriors, 122 extra armor for 6 Warriors, and 24 extra armor for 9 warriors.<br>In the normal match, the flow of fighters usually chooses 6 fighters as the core of the lineup, so it is usually the peak period of the battle in the later 8 population. In this period, the lineup of the dominant players is basically formed, and the combat ability is strong. Considering the blood line problem of the inferior players, most of them will choose to die in this period. If they can’t eat chickens, they also need to ensure that the minimum insurance doesn’t deduct points, so they rely on 6 fighters The core of the lineup with other strong company carrying effect is the most common routine in the current warrior flow. However, what I’m going to introduce here is the team system of the nine soldiers’ reckless flow, which is to go all the way to the end, and to crush the enemy from the front by relying on the powerful armor effect and the quality of chess pieces, so that the players can enjoy different pleasure and pleasure. The core of the nine soldiers is the high bonus of full level 24 point armor. All units can enjoy the bonus. When facing the lineup with physical flow output as the main output, such as sniper flow, assassin flow and other lineups, they can occupy a very favorable battlefield advantage. However, in the face of master blasting flow, the role of armor will be infinitely reduced, so it is the best to respond flexibly according to the actual situation The upper part of the thinking.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Infinite evolution and self-propelled chess analysis of the nine warriors' lineup/5308f7d836474f1699366aff41cbaf74.jpg" alt="Infinite evolution and self-propelled chess analysis of the nine warriors&#39; lineup"><br>In fact, in the later stage, most of the pieces will become cannon fodder, which will pull out output space for a few core pieces. Among them, the most critical pieces are the two units of sword slave and sword slave.<br>Sabre slave passive skill effect: 20% chance to trigger critical hit when attacking, 1 star 300%, 2 star 450%, 3 star 600. Every star level promotion can bring a qualitative change to daonu. In the middle and later stages of the game, with the bonus of soldiers’ company carrying extra armor, daonu’s DPS ability will become stronger and stronger. Sanxing daonu is the strongest guarantee for players to eat chicken.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Infinite evolution and self-propelled chess analysis of the nine warriors' lineup/e219d8ac99c645558beb925e4f6587f3.jpg" alt="Infinite evolution and self-propelled chess analysis of the nine warriors&#39; lineup"><br>As shown in the figure, in the later stage of cosmetic shaping, the damage of 2-star Sabre slaves will have been eliminated. If they are combined with blood sucking clothes, they will almost have the strength of one carry in the later stage. The best point of another core unit, JianNu, is that chess skills can cause high AoE damage. The more powerful the later stage is, and during the release of skills, JianNu will gain The effect of immune control and skill damage. When the warrior flow encounters the skill damage based lineup such as spell flow in the later period, the sword slave will become the strongest core of the team.</p>
<h1 id="practical-thinking-and-operation-process"><a href="#practical-thinking-and-operation-process" class="headerlink" title="practical thinking and operation process"></a>practical thinking and operation process</h1><p><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Infinite evolution and self-propelled chess analysis of the nine warriors' lineup/6638a56c71214d0db2c154b0bf500246.jpg" alt="Infinite evolution and self-propelled chess analysis of the nine warriors&#39; lineup"><br>Early goal: three soldiers + two beasts or two puppets.<br>Warrior flow has a total of 10 pieces in the game, and is evenly distributed among low, medium and high fees. In the game, it is almost impossible to jam hands, and the operation is simple. For some players with dark faces, warrior flow is a very good top-down lineup system. In the early stage, because the giant toothed elephant and the fierce poisonous beast belong to the beast warrior, they can form three battle pairs at the minimum population of 3 The combination of beasts is very powerful, while the sword slave and the sword slave belong to the same puppet warrior. Even in the early stage, they can be matched with axe slave and other pieces to form a double puppet company. For the warrior flow, almost all pieces can be matched, including assassins, mages, guards, auxiliary, etc. if you always feel bad luck and have nothing to do in the early stage, then come Play warrior, and don’t worry about the frequent occurrence of early hand jams.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Infinite evolution and self-propelled chess analysis of the nine warriors' lineup/8a7cf9029a6e43c690525534f2acb45f.jpg" alt="Infinite evolution and self-propelled chess analysis of the nine warriors&#39; lineup"><br>In the mid-term, there is no doubt that the six warriors will be our most important goal. The three warriors can only increase their armor by 4 points, which has a very common effect. However, the six warriors’ armor has been increased to 12 points directly. In the mid-term, the large-scale recruit team system, which mainly focuses on skill damage, is still in a semi formed state. At this time, the main body of damage is still physical output, so the armor company carrying effect of the six Warriors Fruit promotion is very large, once formed, it can almost establish the dominant position in the middle period, without fear of any playing system.<br>In addition, when the population is 7, it can be matched with a fire dance or nakelu to form a double combatant family to further improve the team’s output ability. However, if you are not lucky enough in the early stage, you can also match with some other powerful single cards, such as the output of Lei Zhenzi in the back row, the front row anti armour killing bee, AoE damage electric Jiao, etc. the compatibility of 6 fighters is very strong Almost fearless. In the mid-term, we rely on the transition of powerful chess pieces to accumulate economy and prepare for the later 9 population.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Infinite evolution and self-propelled chess analysis of the nine warriors' lineup/28927a9f99eb4feda009b8e73591d053.jpg" alt="Infinite evolution and self-propelled chess analysis of the nine warriors&#39; lineup"><br>In the later stage, once the 9 soldiers are formed, the physical defense ability can reach the peak. However, if we want to eat chicken, Samsung pieces will become our biggest help. It is suggested that Samsung ideas, the core output of sword slaves is the highest priority, followed by 1-star low-cost pieces, Samsung is relatively low in difficulty, and 4-fee and above pieces are all suggested that 2-star is enough, high-cost pieces are too difficult It’s very easy to hold the rhythm, and the core of warrior flow, sword slave and sword slave, are chess pieces of 2 or 3 fees. Samsung’s role is also higher, so taking this as the goal, the probability of eating chicken is higher.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>I’m half a sci-fi fan. I like both space theme and future war movies and TV works very much. I met the first sci-fi FPS game “Battlefield 2142” in my life under a friend’s Amway. As a derivative and sequel of the battlefield series, 2142 has a very good battlefield atmosphere and a variety of advanced weapons and vehicles for use in the game. In that era when piracy was rampant in China, even the man-machine sitting in front of the computer for a day enjoyed it. Battlefield 2142 is a competitive FPS combining science fiction and battlefield, which has been exposed in the players’ field of vision to the greatest extent. It has become the enlightenment work of many players for this kind of game. At the same time, it has its own excellent quality. Although its influence is not as good as the battlefield series, it is also a good work.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is FPS and MMO still in the works See if the comeback planetary margin can be a shame before snow/64cdca80428e41da84d2d7244cc50eba.jpg" alt="Is FPS and MMO still in the works See if the comeback planetary margin can be a shame before snow"><br>When I was in high school, I happened to see an online game advertisement, which was also a science fiction FPS, and claimed that the game was similar to Battlefield 2142, but its scale was several times larger. When I saw this sentence, I was immediately interested in it, and then I searched for the game called Xingxing marginal 2 on the Internet. After a period of time, addicted to them, and then because no friends to play with the pit, never again on the line.<br>When we heard the name of “planetary margin” again, the national service of the game had been stopped. Until recently, the development team of the game finally determined the production plan of the sequel “planetary edge 3”, which made fans like me finally see the hope again.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is FPS and MMO still in the works See if the comeback planetary margin can be a shame before snow/0b0081615ea24d98be9cbebd51c4819f.jpg" alt="Is FPS and MMO still in the works See if the comeback planetary margin can be a shame before snow"></p>
<h1 id="unique"><a href="#unique" class="headerlink" title="unique"></a>unique</h1><p>Speaking of Sony online entertainment (SOE for short), many players may feel strange and familiar. This is a branch of Sony that has been focusing on the research and development of online games since its establishment. Its representative, endless tasks, as the originator of 3dmmorpg online games, achieved great success and influence at that time, both at home and abroad Loud force.<br>It’s not long after entering the 21st century. It’s also the most popular time for many people to fight FPS. Famous works such as anti terrorist elite and Legion fortress are very popular. SOE wants to develop a competitive FPS with multiple people. Considering that it has experience in developing MMO games, SOE doesn’t plan to make a similar FPS For the small map confrontation like s, we need to make it bigger. Simply let hundreds of people play on one map at the same time. There is no so-called score of innings. Just like a real war, when can we occupy the whole map and end it, and then start the next round of war. This is mmofps, SOE named this game during the period of the great red《 Planetside, translated as “interstellar online” by Chinese agent.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is FPS and MMO still in the works See if the comeback planetary margin can be a shame before snow/42db817f7c2848b1beeab2231ffd33ab.jpg" alt="Is FPS and MMO still in the works See if the comeback planetary margin can be a shame before snow"><br>Planet side<br>There is no clear division of labor in star ol, but there are different factions. The characters controlled by players are like a piece of white paper. You can draw as you like. You can be a fighter pilot or a tank hand, or a heavy fire infantry with a missile and a thunder. The weapon configuration can be selected at will in the game. This height is self-contained The design of the definition requires the player’s “RP spirit” to a great extent. After all, this is a battlefield, and different players need to share different work and implement tactics to cooperate with each other, so that they can fight with the enemy most efficiently. The goal is to kill other players in the battalions against your enemy, and carry out a long-lasting territory on a huge map that can hold 300 people Fight for.<br>Although the game was not famous compared with other FPS at first, it still gained a lot of fans with its super large-scale combat mode and super highly customized game playing method. After all, at that time, science fiction players were still easy to find.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is FPS and MMO still in the works See if the comeback planetary margin can be a shame before snow/fe2c8cc75559466d86b34fa99b351dca.jpg" alt="Is FPS and MMO still in the works See if the comeback planetary margin can be a shame before snow"><br>On the top of the road<br>Of course, although this game is very fun, there are many problems. In most of the game processes, players spend half of their time to rush from the resurrection point to the fighting place. In view of the huge map, it may take a lot of time. At the same time, as an MMO game, because the game rhythm is slow, there is no time and the setting of compulsory participation in the war, the players can wander and explore in the game map at will outside the battle, but outside the battle, the game has almost no playability, nothing more than talking with other players of our members, and drawing a few simple actions for interaction.<br>In the nearly 13 years of operation, SOE has only launched four major version updates for this game. The slow update frequency and the playability that can’t be enhanced all the time are undoubtedly fatal for an online game. SOE naturally knows how the performance of this game is and where the problem is. But at this time, the development of electronic games has entered a high-speed era, and its expansion The repair and update of the flag and drum is not as direct as the development of a new work. So the development and opinion collection of the sequel started by SOE. As for interstellar ol, it depends on how long life can live.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is FPS and MMO still in the works See if the comeback planetary margin can be a shame before snow/dee16743af0542ef94ca3f61d52f1bfc.jpg" alt="Is FPS and MMO still in the works See if the comeback planetary margin can be a shame before snow"><br>At the E3 game exhibition a year ago, when star OL was out of service, SOE released the game preview of planet edge 2. This time, the game was built with a new engine, and the scale of the battlefield was expanded from 300 to 2000. For those players who had played before, it felt like “hey, I can’t do it”. At that time, the whole game industry also paid high attention to this game, and the media also praised the achievement of SOE this time. Many players wanted to experience it in the “big battlefield”.<br>However, in the era of information development, the mainstream players were not the old players who played the previous games, but a new group of new players who played various fast-paced games. For the game of “planetary edge 2”, they could only use the form of “confused”. They thought it was like “anti terrorist elite”, but they just made the scale of thousands of people At the meeting, the change of the world is driven by players like MMO games, and many people can’t adapt to this slower game mode, so the number of players in the game fluctuates greatly for a period of time. First, a large number of players rush into the game, and then only some loyal fans and old players are still insisting, and the total number of these players is less than one million.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is FPS and MMO still in the works See if the comeback planetary margin can be a shame before snow/ca26d130077a48359efb2d2812e8ab36.jpg" alt="Is FPS and MMO still in the works See if the comeback planetary margin can be a shame before snow"><br>Planetary margin 2<br>Planetary edge 2 is represented by the ninth city on the mainland. It is believed that a large number of players have heard about the company before they contact the company, and the company’s main business is not online games. The content of “planetary edge 2” represented by the ninth city is basically the same as that of the international service, but the price of some props in the game is much more expensive than that of the international service. At the same time, there are many bugs in the game when it is launched, and the official has been trying to fix them, while the national service will not push an update for a long time, and even the update is extremely rare Repair Bug. As a game of setting up servers in China, it seems that the scale of 2000 people in the same picture is a little overloaded for Jiucheng. Therefore, in most of the time, there is a rare phenomenon that national service is more difficult to log in than international service.<br>Expensive game props, coupled with mindless game experience, even though Jiucheng has spent a lot of energy on the promotion of the game, it still can’t save the situation that the players are always losing. Obviously, they didn’t do their work where they should. On the other hand, SOE is also busy developing a zombie themed eschatological survival game, which is the familiar h1z1, so it largely ignores the operation and maintenance of planetary edge 2.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is FPS and MMO still in the works See if the comeback planetary margin can be a shame before snow/8f3ccc6e13854be59b5282675ffd276a.jpg" alt="Is FPS and MMO still in the works See if the comeback planetary margin can be a shame before snow"><br>    concluding remarks<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is FPS and MMO still in the works See if the comeback planetary margin can be a shame before snow/03c51f8921a04e70b53010c60f4075ca.jpg" alt="Is FPS and MMO still in the works See if the comeback planetary margin can be a shame before snow"><br>Planetary margin: Arena<br>“Planetary margin 2” came to an early end in the national service, largely because of the agency’s inattention and inaction, while the international service has been active for a long time. But as time goes by, this game mode is no longer popular, and as time goes by, this game has gradually lost its popularity. Even though it has created excellent reputation, there are still many problems in the game itself that need to be modified, and these problems are exactly the reason why this type of game can not receive the attention of players at present. Currently, the SOE that left Sony changed its name to daybreak games, and brought the derivative work “planetary edge: arena” for transition. Soon, planetary edge 3 will be developed, hoping that this time they can learn from the previous failure and succeed in shining again in the current game market. After all, this game is really fun.</p>

    <title>Is the game fun ruiner, also from Poland, but different from cyberpunk</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/Is%20the%20game%20fun%20ruiner,%20also%20from%20Poland,%20but%20different%20from%20cyberpunk/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Recently, an animation called “no guns life” has attracted my attention. In this animation, many people have received different degrees of mechanical transformation due to various reasons, some are part of the body, some are the whole body, even the main character’s head is a left-handed gun, and these people are called “expansionists” “ But even if everyone has mechanical transformation, it doesn’t make everyone have a better life. This high-tech low life setting is like cyberpunk, but it’s far from the taste of cyberpunk.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is the game fun ruiner, also from Poland, but different from cyberpunk/6f149235a3ce418084591882dc6685ce.jpg" alt="Is the game fun ruiner, also from Poland, but different from cyberpunk"><br>Not to mention the reputation of animation, at least I am very interested in this theme, and watching this animation always reminds me of a game called “ruiner”, although the styles of the two are quite different, and the latter has a more strong cyberpunk flavor, which always gives me a very similar feeling. When it comes to cyberpunk, some people will suddenly think of the upcoming release of “cyberpunk 2077” in Polish CD project red next year. Coincidentally, this “ruiner” is also made by a group of poles, but it has created a different cyberpunk world.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is the game fun ruiner, also from Poland, but different from cyberpunk/39129e1a15204f33a2edbc028e66ab2f.jpg" alt="Is the game fun ruiner, also from Poland, but different from cyberpunk"><br>Enlighten<br>When I first saw this game at E3 game show in 2017, it’s hard not to associate it with another classic, Miami hotline, because the publisher of “ruiner” is devolver, an independent game giant, and “ruiner” is an action shooting game overlooking the corner. The protagonist is wearing a leather jacket, a mask, and a variety of guns and weapons Killing Sifang is as manic as devolver’s previous games, but it seems to give people a feeling of “the game should be cool”.<br>Some people may not believe that such an irascible game is actually made by a woman, Magdalena tomkowicz (hereinafter referred to as MT). She is a journalist, but somehow later joined the game industry, and once really worked in the cdpr of “Polish donkey”, and the reason for her to engage in the game industry is purely because of her childhood passion for games Love and a cavity of their own blood, who can think of doing so has been insisting on doing down.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is the game fun ruiner, also from Poland, but different from cyberpunk/30b76e7d7c4d4c56bd5ba4b25e332c2a.jpg" alt="Is the game fun ruiner, also from Poland, but different from cyberpunk"><br>The protagonist’s style and grumpiness are all written on his face<br>It was almost the same opportunity as other independent game studios when they were founded. At the time of cdpr’s inauguration, MT saw her company develop a little bit, but MAG still felt that she couldn’t accept the rules and restrictions of large companies. As employees, they didn’t have the opportunity to do what she really liked, so she left cdpr with her husband and set up reikon games studio.<br>Even if they choose to do something with their own thoughts, they are confused when they let themselves play at will. Their only inspiration is the classic sci-fi film “blade killer” released in the early years. The members of the studio like the close and dreamlike cyberpunk style in the film, but they don’t think they are that You know about cyberpunk, if you choose this style rashly, the final product may be questioned by the players, so they choose to use the cyberpunk elements on the surface of the game as much as possible, without deep-seated content, so in their view, in fact, this game is not a cyberpunk game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is the game fun ruiner, also from Poland, but different from cyberpunk/7888562d1627403abc70e534748416a5.jpg" alt="Is the game fun ruiner, also from Poland, but different from cyberpunk"><br>Blade killer</p>
<h1 id="violence-against-violence"><a href="#violence-against-violence" class="headerlink" title="violence against violence"></a>violence against violence</h1><p>In fact, although “ruiner” looks like “Miami hotline”, in fact, the game type selection of “ruiner” is influenced by “Miami hotline”. It is also a fast-paced downward looking angle shooting, but it is not as hard core as “Miami hotline”. As mentioned above, the protagonist controlled by the player can kill all sides with all kinds of weapons, but if it’s so simple, it’s a bit monotonous, so the importance of setting is reflected.<br>There is a big word “brother” written on the back of the protagonist’s leather coat. You don’t know what you should do or where you should go. The protagonist met a hacker beauty by chance. All the targets and actions of the protagonist were designated by the woman. The woman didn’t know why she wanted to help the protagonist, and said that the protagonist’s brother was kidnapped. The woman can To guide the protagonist to save his own brother.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is the game fun ruiner, also from Poland, but different from cyberpunk/faf6806585844c2ea15e526385f31103.jpg" alt="Is the game fun ruiner, also from Poland, but different from cyberpunk"><br>Early character set<br>The protagonist doesn’t say a word, but he can clearly show his emotions on his mask, so that others can’t see his face, but they can know his mood, which is one of the core of the game design ideas: MT wants to create a protagonist image that even the players themselves will feel some fear, put the mask on him and don’t explain this clearly People’s life experience can increase the mystery of the protagonist, and the design of only killing can make the player feel that the protagonist is very cold and ferocious.<br>The whole game uses bright red and black to set off the brutal game atmosphere in the game, and integrates many very common settings in cyberpunk, such as high-tech low life, gangs and prostitutes everywhere, street buildings like downtown Tokyo, as well as the Hong Kong Style scenes and signs that can be seen everywhere, and the American style unrestrained atmosphere Rich, but the illustration and vertical painting are all Japanese style, these very iconic symbols can only appear in anyone’s mind four words:   cyberpunk  .<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is the game fun ruiner, also from Poland, but different from cyberpunk/437790bc6cb14671bdea6f4f219b3572.jpg" alt="Is the game fun ruiner, also from Poland, but different from cyberpunk"><br>Most of the female characters in the game are basically in this style<br>Based on the above two concepts, a unique effect is formed that everything in the game is eye-catching, but only a small part of the content can be remembered by the players. Even when talking with NPC, most of them only have two options of “nod” and “shrug”. The players don’t need to think too much about how to choose, only “yes” and “I don’t care” ”Two kinds of expressions enable the player to enter the same state as the protagonist, only need to know where to go and who to kill. The player can pay more attention to the fighting system of the game, and the story of the game itself has never risen to the level of discussion on human nature of cyberpunk in the past.<br>Different from Miami hot line, the protagonist and the enemy in the game are not necessarily killed in one shot, and the protagonist can use a variety of skills, such as the most basic “bullet time” and fast Dodge, which can enable the protagonist to come and go freely in the battle, or improve the defense and attack power without brain and hard encounter with the enemy, have talent tree and reset skill points at any time Enter, as for which way to fight, it depends on the player’s mood.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is the game fun ruiner, also from Poland, but different from cyberpunk/2f6b0c78bbef45ac85190436e7506c78.jpg" alt="Is the game fun ruiner, also from Poland, but different from cyberpunk"><br>At the same time, the angle of view is 45, so the hands need to adapt<br>    concluding remarks<br>It’s worth mentioning that little sister hacker will give you evaluation in every battle. When you lose, she will also give you a hint of Yan characters to calm the frustration of the players. It can be said that she understands the ideas of the players very well. However, some people say that the process of the game is a little short. In fact, such a game is not recommended to be played for a long time.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is the game fun ruiner, also from Poland, but different from cyberpunk/8c43cd910aca4195a8ea065d404f1593.jpg" alt="Is the game fun ruiner, also from Poland, but different from cyberpunk"><br>Why “ruiner” is very similar to “non gun life” is mainly because they all have a very representative symbol of cyberpunk, but they only touch the iceberg corner of cyberpunk, and they are particularly inclined to the hardline style in the atmosphere shaping. “Non gun” tells an alternative story from a relatively unique perspective, which is thought-provoking, compared with “Ruiner” is just to let the players let go of all the unhappiness in the game and let out.</p>

    <title>Is this game fun Samurai 3A&#39;s masterpiece benevolence king, which is a game made by developers for themselves</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/Is%20this%20game%20fun%20Samurai%203A&#39;s%20masterpiece%20benevolence%20king,%20which%20is%20a%20game%20made%20by%20developers%20for%20themselves/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>2017 is a year of “fairy fight” for players. Legend of Zelda and Super Mario have finally launched a very powerful orthodox new work after many years. Players are looking forward to the release of “the last guardian” and “Final Fantasy 15” in this year, and the TGA award ceremony in that year was particularly wonderful, In the humble corner, there is also a piece of work that finally ushered in the birth after many years. Its name is “benevolence king”, from glorious tekumo.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun Samurai 3A's masterpiece benevolence king, which is a game made by developers for themselves/ff5205866daf462e8eb51d376a45d3d8.jpg" alt="Is this game fun Samurai 3A&#39;s masterpiece benevolence king, which is a game made by developers for themselves"><br>Compared with the above works, maybe not many people can remember that RenWang was published as early as 14 years ago, but other games sometimes release some news to keep the players’ memory. As for RenWang, it seems that there is no voice since it was published. In any case, it’s lucky that the game can finally be made, but if it doesn’t work, it’s amazing. If it doesn’t work, RenWang will become a black horse of that year. It’s also a hardline ARPG game. In a short period of time, it can become a work almost in line with the series of black soul, which shows that this game seems to be really not to be underestimated.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun Samurai 3A's masterpiece benevolence king, which is a game made by developers for themselves/9df8e0e24c1f4df9ac2a6881cbd9091f.jpg" alt="Is this game fun Samurai 3A&#39;s masterpiece benevolence king, which is a game made by developers for themselves"></p>
<h1 id="inherent-image"><a href="#inherent-image" class="headerlink" title="inherent image"></a>inherent image</h1><p>As we all know, today’s KT is a combination of glory and tekumo, two Japanese game companies. In the early years, glory was devoted to creating all kinds of real historical theme games, such as “Three Kingdoms” and “biography of Taige’s ambition”, which are the love of many old players who like historical themes. Their games not only have extremely close to historical records and settings Ding, and in terms of the performance and restoration of the details, was almost the leader in the industry at that time; while tekumo focused on building action games in the early years, and was known as one of the “three act” games, “Ninja dragon sword biography” and “death or life” were their Golden signboards. For a long time, they have focused on the same style or theme, and these games have gradually become the inherent image of these companies in the view of players. After the merger of the two companies, they are still doing their own. They also realize that this is not the way in the long run, and RenWang has become an opportunity to bring the two companies closer.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun Samurai 3A's masterpiece benevolence king, which is a game made by developers for themselves/984b6fc56bd24b01aac1998a8c509b5b.jpg" alt="Is this game fun Samurai 3A&#39;s masterpiece benevolence king, which is a game made by developers for themselves"><br>Glorious tekumo<br>“Benevolence king” was originally the IP designed for glory. In the original plan, the protagonist of the story has been placed in the Warring States period, and the protagonist has been set as an English Japanese mixed warrior, and the game is defined as “the fantasy RPG of the Warring States period”, but RPG can not make the sense of action and presence like the series of “matchless”. If it is ARPG, it will collide with “matchless Warring States period”. Since There is no need to make another RPG with the same theme in the war, so this IP has been put on hold. After the merger of the company, Guangrong gave this IP to team ninja, who developed the new Ninja dragon sword biography, and team Ninja still couldn’t get out of the framework of the Ninja when he was designing. After all, the style of the two games is too similar. Now team ninja and the Ninja have to do the Ninja 3, so this IP was put on hold again until from software with the “soul” system Listed in the game set off a wave of “suffering” boom, just gave KT new inspiration.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun Samurai 3A's masterpiece benevolence king, which is a game made by developers for themselves/ebff746ca81740deb8bc7a06d81a4aa3.jpg" alt="Is this game fun Samurai 3A&#39;s masterpiece benevolence king, which is a game made by developers for themselves"><br>Originally published “benevolence king”</p>
<h1 id="“black-soul”-“forbearance-dragon”"><a href="#“black-soul”-“forbearance-dragon”" class="headerlink" title="“black soul” + “forbearance dragon”"></a>“black soul” + “forbearance dragon”</h1><p>When RenWang released the real machine demonstration, many players said that they were not optimistic about the game, because any player who has played or seen the soul of darkness would feel that RenWang is completely imitating the mode of black soul, and it is not too much to call it “plagiarism”. However, when the game is officially released, the attitude of the players is totally 180 degrees. The players and the media who have played have been full of praise for it, forming a strong contrast with the previous situation. In terms of the design of the basic system, benevolence king is indeed very similar to black soul. Attack, sprint and dodge all need to consume endurance bars. In addition, the adding point system is also upgraded by adding a point. Using the archive point will refresh the monsters and so on. This is not to be washed. As early as in other places, RenWang did make a taste that only they could make. For example, the fall of equipment is more RPG oriented, more random, and the strong “glorious historical flavor” in the game is also more intense. Although the screen performance of the game is not particularly good, but there is no Jerry in the performance of details.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun Samurai 3A's masterpiece benevolence king, which is a game made by developers for themselves/54779c3aa71447b9a781ff6220730e99.jpg" alt="Is this game fun Samurai 3A&#39;s masterpiece benevolence king, which is a game made by developers for themselves"><br>Scenes and human settings with strong historical flavor<br>The most worthwhile thing to talk about is the combat system of the game. In the past “soul” series of games, the combat system is not too fancy. In addition to some specific weapons, all kinds of actions and moves of the character are very simple and single, and the too fancy moves are far less direct than the ones directly flattening a. In “benevolence king”, the combat system of the game refers to the Japanese Kendo culture to a great extent. Many moves and postures of weapons are designed with reference to the movements in the real Kendo and slightly modified. Any kind of weapon is divided into three postures: upper, middle and lower. The attack power of the upper part is large, the attack power of the lower part is slow, and the attack power of the lower part is opposite, while the middle part is between them 。<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun Samurai 3A's masterpiece benevolence king, which is a game made by developers for themselves/ad250567c9864f7a822817d214837b90.jpg" alt="Is this game fun Samurai 3A&#39;s masterpiece benevolence king, which is a game made by developers for themselves"><br>Lower segment attack<br>When attacking, the character’s moves are more abundant and used, and the skill setting and “Maixin” system are introduced. The so-called “Maixin” is the concept of the actual existence in kendo, which means to guard against the opponent’s heart at all times, which means that we can’t relax until we defeat the enemy completely. After a set of attacks, players can recover their endurance value by triggering the disabled heart at the right time to launch attacks again. In the battle, some enemies will also release a kind of aura called “Changshi”. Standing in it will weaken the players’ endurance recovery ability. Only by triggering the broken heart can the Changshi be removed and the enemy’s endurance recovery be limited. This system is the core of the whole combat system. It seems that the authorities also encourage players to master this system skillfully. After skills are pointed out in the later stage, the above three moves can also be used with the disability system to play a better effect.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun Samurai 3A's masterpiece benevolence king, which is a game made by developers for themselves/e2ebfee58a1d48a0989bd5b2f207853b.jpg" alt="Is this game fun Samurai 3A&#39;s masterpiece benevolence king, which is a game made by developers for themselves"><br>Chang Shi</p>
<h1 id="each-has-its-own-strengths"><a href="#each-has-its-own-strengths" class="headerlink" title="each has its own strengths"></a>each has its own strengths</h1><p>Although team Ninja is responsible for most of the development of the game, glory has also given a lot of help in the development of the game. Later, the setting was changed to a semi real historical theme, and the protagonist was William Adams, the first Englishman who came to Japan. He has a more familiar name, Sanpu press needle, and glory has developed its own advantages in this regard Opportunity: for the depiction and shaping of history related content, each piece of equipment and weapon in the game has its own rigorous settings and details, such as the knife edge is upward when it is used to make a knife, while the Taidao is downward. Each piece of unique props and equipment also has different settings and background stories, which can be described as a good intention to satisfy the details of the party.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun Samurai 3A's masterpiece benevolence king, which is a game made by developers for themselves/8f2c7c635e564f1ab5d0b38df4a78dd6.jpg" alt="Is this game fun Samurai 3A&#39;s masterpiece benevolence king, which is a game made by developers for themselves"><br>The design of the guardian spirit has its own story<br>The design of character action and modeling is tekumo’s specialty. The overall operation feel of the game is very similar to that of “the dragon”. However, due to the different fighting ideas, King Ren is doomed to fail to complete the fast-paced game like “the dragon”. The connection between each action of the character is very natural, and the design level of tekumo, who made his fortune by buying DLC clothes, is also natural. It is needless to say that the equipment worn by the character in the game is rarely ugly or too fantastic. On the other hand, the game’s effects such as weather treatment and scene destruction, which are much larger than that of “black soul”, are also derived from the design idea of “tolerance dragon”. Although the “tolerance dragon” series may be gone, at least it can experience that taste in “benevolence King”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun Samurai 3A's masterpiece benevolence king, which is a game made by developers for themselves/97b2b7e7c9ad4cbc9c03ad6dd7a2c825.jpg" alt="Is this game fun Samurai 3A&#39;s masterpiece benevolence king, which is a game made by developers for themselves"><br>Good equipment and no play<br>    concluding remarks<br>After all, we have to talk about the disadvantages. For example, the map design of the game is relatively compact, the rendering of the environment is relatively simple, and the equipment drop design with strong randomness makes the game more inclined to RPG. Although these defects are relatively obvious, they do not have a great impact on the game experience. For a brand-new IP produced from scratch, we can achieve the same degree of completion as The volume is not easy. Although it borrows the light of its peers to a large extent, it’s good that it has many innovations that are more outstanding. If you like the “soul like” game, you should not miss this work.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun Samurai 3A's masterpiece benevolence king, which is a game made by developers for themselves/a36b9750495044a4bab70f6f5882c8f0.jpg" alt="Is this game fun Samurai 3A&#39;s masterpiece benevolence king, which is a game made by developers for themselves"><br>Although RenWang was a game two years ago, it doesn’t affect that people still mention his excellence when they talk about him today. The first formal cooperation between glory and tekumo is a surprise. RenWang is not only glorious and rigorous, but also bold and unconstrained. After the popularity of “matchless” series and “death or life”, the integrated “RenWang” is also the direction of shaping a new image of the company in the future, changing the inherent image of the two companies. It can be said that I hope that the upcoming “RenWang 2” will have a relatively stable or better performance.</p>

    <title>Is this game fun cartoon style can also be very hard core empty Knight</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/Is%20this%20game%20fun%20cartoon%20style%20can%20also%20be%20very%20hard%20core%20empty%20Knight/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In the era of 3A games and competitive online games, independent games often give players a lot of surprises and unexpected gains. The reason why independent games are called independent games is that their production cost is low and the volume is not large. The developers may only have a single digit, but they still have very excellent production quality. They do not have those near real top-level pictures, nor those magnificent game scenes. Some of them often only have an excellent story, an eye-catching design, and a It’s full of praise and creativity.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun cartoon style can also be very hard core empty Knight/fd8865e8d56d47e0877fedb75847cd5e.jpg" alt="Is this game fun cartoon style can also be very hard core empty Knight"><br>In the field of independent game development, due to the limitation of cost and the lack of technical force, independent gamers often only choose 2D screen as the expression form. Some of them like to use the retro pixel style, some like to use the delicate hand-painted style, while in terms of playing methods, they especially like rougelite or Metroid Vania. In recent years, a series of “soul” series works launched by form software have attracted more and more attention of players. Therefore, the game playing method of “soul like” has begun to appear frequently in independent games. If we integrate the 2D hand-painted pictures, the Metroid Vania’s playing methods and the “soul like” mechanism, we will get this independent game collection called “empty Knight”.</p>
<h1 id="three-for-three-years"><a href="#three-for-three-years" class="headerlink" title="three for three years"></a>three for three years</h1><p>It seems that in the games we usually play or common games, we seldom see games made in Australia. I can often hear friends who have gone to Australia to study abroad say: I thought I could experience the rich game atmosphere of overseas players when I went to Australia, but in fact, none of them particularly like playing games. They prefer sports to playing games And social activities. In Australia, the market of video games is not very good, so there are only a handful of developers and distributors, but a small number of them do not mean that they do not. There are still a group of people who are passionate about games. Team cherry (cherry group) was founded in 2012 by Ali Gibson, William peron and Lohan Fraser. All three are enthusiastic independent gamers with their own strengths. They have participated in game jam (short-term game design, usually need to plan a game in one or two days) held in various places for many times Decent game works), so the three decided to officially establish a studio and become a fixed game development team.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun cartoon style can also be very hard core empty Knight/bdf8d70d98d940d1a7b9a746b210a292.jpg" alt="Is this game fun cartoon style can also be very hard core empty Knight"><br>The first three<br>Unfortunately, Lohan, one of the three, left the studio before the game was approved, and a musician named Christopher Larkin joined the team to fill the gap. Ali is an animator, so he is responsible for most of the art work in the game. William proposed that all the characters in the game should be designed as bugs, so that not only large-scale creation is easy, but also many interesting characters can be easily drawn, just like the animation created in the past. In order to create these insect characters, Ali even needs to spend a period of time observing insects every day. On the other hand, William wants to simply integrate his favorite play method of galactic demon city with “soul like”. He enjoys the play method of exploring and challenging in the unknown world. These two themes are completely in line with his taste, while Christopher is responsible for it Most of the music and sound effects in the game were produced. The game was approved in 2014 and initially crowdfunded on the KickStarter platform. It was not completed and listed until 2017.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun cartoon style can also be very hard core empty Knight/58d488d192fc4ee4aee46c1eb82faa76.jpg" alt="Is this game fun cartoon style can also be very hard core empty Knight"><br>Design manuscript</p>
<h1 id="“spirit-of-galactic-demon-city”"><a href="#“spirit-of-galactic-demon-city”" class="headerlink" title="“spirit of galactic demon city”"></a>“spirit of galactic demon city”</h1><p>Because the characters are all worms, it’s hard not to separate from the underground world. In essence, the playing method of empty knight is a 2D horizontal action game. The main character Knight played by the player needs to explore in a huge underground world. Although the cartoon hand painting style of the game is so cute that it doesn’t feel like a game developed by a group of old men, the overall color of the game However, Diao reveals a desolate and depressing atmosphere like black soul. One of the major characteristics of Galaxy demon city is that it splices multiple intricate horizontal maps together to form a huge map. The explorable content is distributed in all corners of the map, and the route of each section is designed in all directions. If the back board ability is a little bit poor, the players may be lost playing, which is the excellent performance of map design, although At first glance, it’s a bit messy but actually smooth. If you really forget the road, you can find a cartographer to buy a map, but only the places you have explored can be displayed on the map.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun cartoon style can also be very hard core empty Knight/f48d100fe05441778ab04f95d11dfcaf.jpg" alt="Is this game fun cartoon style can also be very hard core empty Knight"><br>The map is only an aid, but more often, you need to fumble for the scene by yourself<br>As an ARPG game, the combat system of “empty Knight” is very simple and easy to understand, with only one or two attack modes and some mobile moves, so many players will think that the operation of this game is a little simple. In fact, in many horizontal games in the early years, the protagonist often only has one or two attack methods. The main point is that the time of each attack is the more different enemies are faced in the later stage, the more different ways of thinking about the attack will be used. Even if there are only one or two moves, players can still get the pleasure of “insight”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun cartoon style can also be very hard core empty Knight/f910542d8b21439cb0493f5e428b02b6.jpg" alt="Is this game fun cartoon style can also be very hard core empty Knight"><br>Common attacks are simple, but they are very practical<br>Although the map design of the game has the flavor of galactic demon city, in fact, its design idea is similar to the series of soul of darkness. Under a 2D plane image, it shows a fairly complete urban system for the players, such as the center of the map is the main city, while other areas such as Tiantai, sewer, station and so on are all around the design of the main city. The players can not Some minor details are observed in the same area to fill in the background of the game, which is simply to create a perfect world first, and then involve the plot and characters in the world.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun cartoon style can also be very hard core empty Knight/99ea7f51d91e4840bc53b9c6d69f1cd2.jpg" alt="Is this game fun cartoon style can also be very hard core empty Knight"><br>Many hidden elements need to be felt by players themselves<br>Some of these production techniques have the meaning of fragmented narration. In his early years, he was used in various immersive simulation games, and then was carried forward by the series of black soul. The map and background design of the game have a high degree of completion, and even the characteristics of enemies in different regions can be explained in the game. And the game itself is not so perfect, the most important point is that the galaxy demon city and the “soul like” game are not particularly simple game types, let alone the “empty Knight” which integrates the two game types. Secondly, due to the high degree of completion in the game world, there are only three people in the development team, which leads to some deficiencies in the design of the game itself in terms of player guidance. Most of the time, players will fall into a state that they don’t know what to do and where to go when playing. For players who are used to playing such games, they may still be able to adapt. If they change to be cute new players, 80% of them will be able to adapt Will complain to delete the game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun cartoon style can also be very hard core empty Knight/0a2c0a152ae94fdd88560ac0d54a6964.jpg" alt="Is this game fun cartoon style can also be very hard core empty Knight"><br>Boss war that seems simple but needs to be tried again and again<br>    concluding remarks<br>Every independent game with a high degree of completion has no less influence in the whole industry than other 3A masterpieces. The industry usually doesn’t care about their technological breakthroughs in the game, but their unique design creativity and obsession in the game. In fact, for the independent game people, developing a game is very important Confused, because they don’t know what other players really like, they can’t make games that can please the public, so they can only make works that can be considered good games in their own eyes, and in most cases, only games born with this idea as the main purpose are more likely to leave a deep impression for people.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun cartoon style can also be very hard core empty Knight/f1c793b35f834c56ad8ae27bd340ee10.jpg" alt="Is this game fun cartoon style can also be very hard core empty Knight"><br>It is worth mentioning that the cherry group announced the news of the sequel “empty Knight: Song of silk” as early as the beginning of this year, but it is still unknown when it can be completed. I hope they can still bring surprises and feelings to the players this time.</p>

    <title>It took 13 years to make the four different games by myself, but the praise rate was as high as 93%</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/It%20took%2013%20years%20to%20make%20the%20four%20different%20games%20by%20myself,%20but%20the%20praise%20rate%20was%20as%20high%20as%2093%25/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to the cultural elements in the game, it seems that as long as there is a macro concept, many things can be associated. For example, when it comes to wasteland, it’s easy to think of such representative works as radiation and the land without owners. When it comes to Japan, it’s easy to think of samurai, kendo, cherry blossom and so on. This is what we often call “cultural output”. Nowadays, when we combine cyberpunk, anti Utopia and Bushido, we can get such a refreshing action game as Samurai: zero. If we combine wasteland, punk and Bushido together, what you think you can get is a cool end steam punk heavy metal cutting game, but in fact, what you get is a kind of independence that is not good-looking or good-looking Game Kenshi.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/It took 13 years to make the four different games by myself, but the praise rate was as high as 93%/f7948896610d43ef8ca3dd160dff0bba.jpg" alt="It took 13 years to make the four different games by myself, but the praise rate was as high as 93%"><br>On December 6, 2018, the game ended its long EA stage and finally ushered in the official release. At first, it didn’t cause any sensation, but two months after the release, it ushered in its spring. It ranked in the top ten of steam’s sales volume and obtained the evaluation of “special praise”. The first time I came into contact with this game, I heard from my friends that they didn’t know who was watching the live broadcast of the host, and this game attracted him, not to say how much fun it looked, but he didn’t see what the game was and how it was played for a long time. Although people who have played the game think it’s great, they still can’t think of the right adjectives when they are making Amway to others.</p>
<p>#You are not Qiu Shengwang<br>Kenshi is an English writing method of “swordsman” in Japanese. The game is a collection of sandbox, survival, role-playing (RPG) and real-time strategy (RTs) systems. It is difficult for people to define what kind of game it is. To be specific, the proportion of survival content in the early stage is large, while in the later stage, the proportion of RPG and RTS is large. As mentioned above, this is a game work that combines waste land, punk and Bushido. After combining these seemingly unrelated elements, it forms the strange looking art style in Kenshi. But it’s not against the artistic style. You can see soldiers in Warring States armor are gang members in the desert with a high-tech arm prosthesis There are ronin wearing long clothes and wooden clogs who are holding a Taidao to kill dinosaurs in the ruins , players named this unique style “sword punk”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/It took 13 years to make the four different games by myself, but the praise rate was as high as 93%/2d1f02dccd5a466f8c9462fdede22a74.jpg" alt="It took 13 years to make the four different games by myself, but the praise rate was as high as 93%"><br>The whole art style is familiar, but it becomes strange when put together<br>When you open the steam store page of Kenshi, you are not the chosen one will be limited to a large line of words Players who have played “radiation” series should know that the protagonist of the second generation of the series is called “chosen one” by his people, so he has the nickname of “Qiu Shengwang”. As the hope of the whole race, he went into the wasteland alone to search for Eden’s artifact. His combat power is also very strong (because no one before him passed the test), and he can be ranked in the top three in the whole radiation series.<br>In Kenshi, the author of the game emphasizes this idea all the time. Players are only a very small existence in this world, just like horse riding and killing. Even if players don’t do anything, all kinds of big and small things will happen in this world. Players no longer have the halo of the leading role in the previous game. This time, players play the same role In general, NPC, a passerby in GTA, the world doesn’t revolve around you.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/It took 13 years to make the four different games by myself, but the praise rate was as high as 93%/04fd0783574f4c8ebfe104c3415a7dbc.jpg" alt="It took 13 years to make the four different games by myself, but the praise rate was as high as 93%"><br>There is no absolute way to play the game. According to the developers, players have absolute freedom in the Kenshi world. There is no main line, no plot, no tutorial in the game. Players can do anything you can think of. Borrow one of the official introductions of the game machine: choose to be a tooth sacrifice of businessman, thief, rebel, warlord, adventurer, farmer, slave or cannibal. Players can play a lot of roles in the world. As for how to play, the decision lies in the players.<br>“A string of money at the beginning, all the materials are stolen”. It seems that the developers have deliberately weakened the ability of the protagonist. What can’t be done in the early stage, and a lot of work can’t be done by one person alone, so you need a lot of helpers, a lot of helpers, and how to operate these helpers requires the use of RTS operation mode, but the game UI is several times more complex than RTs It’s “persuading people to quit” and “persuading people to quit”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/It took 13 years to make the four different games by myself, but the praise rate was as high as 93%/fa98231fe14746f8b5086f292b3c9d1f.jpg" alt="It took 13 years to make the four different games by myself, but the praise rate was as high as 93%"><br>Complex and ugly UI accounts for a third of the screen</p>
<h1 id="calm-down"><a href="#calm-down" class="headerlink" title="calm down"></a>calm down</h1><p>It’s possible to see that someone here will surely say: such a game has poor picture, boring playing method, and so hard core system. What’s fun. As I mentioned above, the picture difference of the game, which was called ten years ago, is not too much. Even the 2004 “half life 2” is much better than him.<br>But in fact, the game has been in development since 2006, has been produced for 13 years so far this year, and officially released this year. The developer of the game is Chris hunt. He once said that the development of the game is not plain sailing. He loved the game since he was a child. He witnessed the innovation of the video game for many years. In his opinion, the games he played when he was a child, although they were rough in production, backward in picture and lack in technical strength, provided a lot of activity space for the players. Most of the game content All need to be explored by players themselves. Looking back at the current game, I wish I could teach you how to play the game, and I can only follow the process most of the time, which makes Hunter feel the “sense of bondage”, so Hunter decided to develop a game work he wanted.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/It took 13 years to make the four different games by myself, but the praise rate was as high as 93%/4cb49dfd42b2419d8ea16fda846ef136.jpg" alt="It took 13 years to make the four different games by myself, but the praise rate was as high as 93%"><br>The picture of half life 2 is not out of date<br>Hunter has been working alone for six years. During this period, he almost spent all his savings, so he found a security job to subsidize game development. After all, the food is just right. In 2013, Hunter joined in steam’s “light of favor” plan with his game, and started the “early access” stage. With the help of steam, the game was exposed to the players’ vision, contributing a wave of sales for a while, and the game began to have a stable income.<br>At the same time, Hunter felt that his heart was more than his strength, so he set up Lo fi studio to provide updated content for the game. At that time, there were 12 games entering the EA stage, nine of which had already been officially released, and two were cancelled. Only Kenshi was still slowly testing.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/It took 13 years to make the four different games by myself, but the praise rate was as high as 93%/bb0cabc369cd42c99d14160de4902d04.jpg" alt="It took 13 years to make the four different games by myself, but the praise rate was as high as 93%"><br>“Armed raid3” is one of the 12 games<br>The game hasn’t launched the official version, but it’s constantly updating slowly. What’s more, it’s six years later. If we put it in the past Games, the official version will be completely blown out for such a long time. Because Henry’s interaction with the players’ community has never stopped in these six years, and there is a stable update frequency for Kenshi For players, there is no difference between the less formal version. “You need to be prepared to publish games in Early Access, because people’s tastes are very picky, and every bug will make them very impatient,” Hunter once Tucao in this period of time. Finally, the game officially launched the 1.0 official version at the end of 2018, and added simplified Chinese some time ago. This game finally ushered in his most brilliant moment.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/It took 13 years to make the four different games by myself, but the praise rate was as high as 93%/e13553e018d84f51af9832ef1dd75243.jpg" alt="It took 13 years to make the four different games by myself, but the praise rate was as high as 93%"><br>93% of the game<br>    concluding remarks<br>Nowadays, the screen of video game is always “movie grade picture quality” and “audio visual feast”, and its capacity is also growing by tens of hundreds. Although the screen has been improved, it has been discounted in the content of the game, and there are not many games that can have both screen and playability. When you think about it, Kenshi is a game that was developed more than ten years ago. The picture is roughly understandable, but the so-called game, if it’s just good-looking but not fun, is useless.<br>As for the relationship between gameplay and screen, hunter, the author of Kenshi, once said: “not every successful game has a beautiful screen. The famous” underground “looks like a game in the 1980s, but it has been widely praised. Obviously, if players choose games based on the visual performance of 3A works, they will surely miss many unforgettable games The experience. “ It is worth mentioning that hunt and his team Lo fi are planning the development of kenshi2, looking forward to this new “four unlike” work created with new era technology.</p>

    <title>Is this game fun Ubisoft&#39;s most popular IP watchdog, from amazing to disappointed</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/Is%20this%20game%20fun%20Ubisoft&#39;s%20most%20popular%20IP%20watchdog,%20from%20amazing%20to%20disappointed/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>When I talk about Ubisoft, my mood will become very complicated. On the one hand, there are many IP and works I really like, the most popular Assassin’s Creed series and the military theme “Tom Clancy” series with a large number of loyal fans. On the other hand, the first few years of Ubisoft games can always bring unexpected surprises to the players, like They always have endless ghost ideas, but at the same time, they seem to have the habit of “eating the original”. If a design is successful, it will be put into use in all the Games in their own home. It will not be replaced until the players feel disgusted with it, which also leads to one of the biggest reasons why the company’s wind assessment and game sales are not ideal in recent years.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun Ubisoft's most popular IP watchdog, from amazing to disappointed/20969cc654d04543b7b64f0b8cdbc703.jpg" alt="Is this game fun Ubisoft&#39;s most popular IP watchdog, from amazing to disappointed"><br>There are many good games of Ubisoft, some of which can even be handed down and unforgettable, but there are also many games with poor performance. Some of them may only have the scenery before the sale, but after the sale, they are either ordinary and forgotten, or their quality is worrying and reviled. Among the many “victims” of Ubisoft, watchdog is my favorite but regretful work. It could have been equal to Assassin’s creed, but because of its own mistakes, it has ruined its future, and its value may not have been fully played to this day.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun Ubisoft's most popular IP watchdog, from amazing to disappointed/57f541d4b8f04f25a0e1bb7a71a89594.jpg" alt="Is this game fun Ubisoft&#39;s most popular IP watchdog, from amazing to disappointed"><br>    ideal<br>The watchdog is the only work on the market that combines modern hacker themes with open world action games. Its first generation of works was published in 2012, a year earlier than gta5. At that time, it captured the attention of thousands of players by virtue of a real machine demonstration. At that time, it was the end of the previous generation of home hosts. Both the first party and the third-party developers wanted to maximize the performance of the host at this stage, so as to refresh the players’ cognition in advance before the next era. The answer given by Ubisoft was watchdog. In the demonstration, Chicago is full of darkness and sadness from inside to outside. The environment rendering and light and shadow effect in the scene are up to the level that players have never seen before. The modeling, physics and special effects of the game are amazing. In addition, the setting of modern hacker theme and the handsome protagonist are enough to make every single player feel amazing Next generation games have a general understanding.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun Ubisoft's most popular IP watchdog, from amazing to disappointed/d867e920668c4f0a949b854db3cc4728.jpg" alt="Is this game fun Ubisoft&#39;s most popular IP watchdog, from amazing to disappointed"><br>E3 2012 real machine demonstration, now using mod can easily achieve this picture quality<br>Externally, Ubisoft said that it used most of the company’s resources for the development of this game. It is also the largest and most ambitious work ever created by Ubisoft. In order to polish the game better, Ubisoft jumped tickets again and again, and the players are also increasingly looking forward to the sale of the game. However, when the game really comes to hand, the players find that the actual picture of the game is quite different from that of the demonstration, and there is a significant shrinkage phenomenon. In addition, the frame number of the game will fluctuate in the market whether it is the host or the handheld platform, which means that the optimization of the game is very problematic. As a matter of fact, Ubisoft’s pursuit of image expressiveness makes it possible to use relatively high-performance hardware to perform game development work, thus ignoring the real function of the host hardware. When they realize this, they can only choose to reduce the image expressiveness to adapt to the host. Because of this, watchdog has also gained the reputation of “shrinking dog” 。<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun Ubisoft's most popular IP watchdog, from amazing to disappointed/72042cba1eb845cfbfafda9c1355ab59.jpg" alt="Is this game fun Ubisoft&#39;s most popular IP watchdog, from amazing to disappointed"><br>Comparison between demonstration and actual picture</p>
<p>Back to the game itself, even though the game picture of watchdog is far less than the effect of real machine demonstration, it still has a relatively good expressive force. The whole game takes black and white gray as the main color to render the atmosphere of the game darker, which is also very good in line with the plot and story background of the game. In the game, players play the role of “private law sanctioner” Aidan Pierce, who master hacker skills. Because his family is involved in a series of events and killed innocently, he embarks on the road of revenge. The background of the game is set in the highly technical and networked data age. The whole city needs to rely on electronic systems to operate, while players can use their own hacker skills to the city Most of these electronic devices are operated to fight the enemy. With the combination of environment interaction and third person shooting, plus a little mystery solving and open world exploration, watchdog is more interesting in terms of game playing methods.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun Ubisoft's most popular IP watchdog, from amazing to disappointed/e7e7f9c20d454728991b1ce4901cae6f.jpg" alt="Is this game fun Ubisoft&#39;s most popular IP watchdog, from amazing to disappointed"><br>Control urban facilities for your own use<br>However, due to the unique combat system, there are some deficiencies in the operation layout and system, which will greatly affect the fluency of the battle. In fact, there are not many contents that can be “played” in the whole city. After the clearance of the game, the players have no value to continue to play except for looking for the collection and various challenges on the map. But fortunately, the plot of the game itself adds a lot of color to the process of the game. Many people say that the plot of the game is like a black movie. Although it is dark, it will make people laugh bitterly when it is a farce until the end. The characters of several characters in the leading group are well shaped, at least people can remember who they are after watching it Who? In short, the overall quality of watchdog is still excellent, but because of the shrinking problem, many impression points have been deducted, players have too high expectations for it, and the final result can only be disappointing.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun Ubisoft's most popular IP watchdog, from amazing to disappointed/0db7c8ab85b045e29d8cc1c39c4ea92a.jpg" alt="Is this game fun Ubisoft&#39;s most popular IP watchdog, from amazing to disappointed"><br>The protagonist’s design, from character to shape and even his personal weapon, can only be described as “cool”</p>
<p>#The second generation of “masterpieces”<br>In order to make up for the design problems and optimization problems in the early works, and adhering to the tradition of “two generations of masterpieces”, Ubisoft decided to save them in the sequel. As for the quality of the sequel, the system and game content will be filled and modified. In 2017, “watchdog 2” arrived on schedule. This time, the game really did not shrink, and the content of the game has become extremely rich. The operation design has been simplified and redesigned, which is similar to most of the open world action games in the overall experience. But what many fans can’t accept is that the “painting style” of the game has changed from dark to bright. The map has changed from Chicago to San Francisco. The scenery is much better than that of the previous one, but the atmosphere is quite different from that of the previous one, and the protagonist has changed from the handsome “dog boy” Aidan to the black protagonist Marcus. You should know that in the global game market, black is the protagonist There has always been a series of controversies.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun Ubisoft's most popular IP watchdog, from amazing to disappointed/cb5cbb762843473ea5e0e9ab6148b978.jpg" alt="Is this game fun Ubisoft&#39;s most popular IP watchdog, from amazing to disappointed"><br>Second generation hip hop punk elements are more than the previous works<br>Ubisoft is also trying various AI systems in this work. The NPCs in the game will have different reactions when facing different scenes and experiencing different things. The protagonists controlled by the players themselves can also interact with these NPCs in various ways. As long as you are happy, you can even call the police to name and arrest a NPC. The filling, optimization and repetition of content are not high branch tasks. With beautiful scenery and rich gameplay, the overall quality of the game is much better than that of the previous work. However, while improving these contents, Ubisoft seems to ignore one of the most important things, that is, the plot of the game. Many players who have not been exposed to hacker culture and punk culture may not be able to understand the behavior, aesthetics or even spirit of the characters in the watchdog, but Ubisoft seems to have no scruples about this, many of the plots are not understood, and there is no relatively perfect explanation in the game, which leads to the fact that although the plot of the game is not bad, it does not How many people can watch it.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun Ubisoft's most popular IP watchdog, from amazing to disappointed/b7a81ea8d1a64d21ad3c377b6b5eb2cf.jpg" alt="Is this game fun Ubisoft&#39;s most popular IP watchdog, from amazing to disappointed"><br>The setting of notebook also affects the rhythm<br>    concluding remarks<br>Although there are only two works in the watchdog series up to now, there are some painful points. If the first generation was caused by arrogance, then the second generation’s works demolished the east wall and replaced the west wall, and never built a perfect structure for the game itself. It’s a pity that the watchdog is a unique and interesting play method and setting 。 If the two generations of games are combined to form a complement, maybe the new work in the future will be a good one, but perhaps for Ubisoft, the IP that originally wanted to be the pillar has become the mouse in their hands.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun Ubisoft's most popular IP watchdog, from amazing to disappointed/c75aed8be1c043eb879b005d17694ee5.jpg" alt="Is this game fun Ubisoft&#39;s most popular IP watchdog, from amazing to disappointed"><br>Watchdog: Legion<br>Soon to be released, “watchdog: Legion” to operate any role as a selling point, will undoubtedly sacrifice the depth of the game in the plot, so that each role can not have a full image of the game. This is undoubtedly another experimental attempt. Although Ubisoft blows the cowhide to the sky, for example, each character has its own interpersonal relationship, and what the players do may affect the lives of other NPC’s. However, according to Ubisoft’s current wind rating, it seems that the credibility is not very high. If you don’t pay attention, it may become another big thunder. I hope Ubisoft can realize what they are doing, after all, in the current situation, it seems that the market has not allowed them to fail again.</p>

    <title>Is this game fun Waste punk FPS rage, simple, direct and powerless</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/Is%20this%20game%20fun%20Waste%20punk%20FPS%20rage,%20simple,%20direct%20and%20powerless/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Back eight years ago, it was a time when the best single player game was in full swing. The Ezio trilogy of Assassin’s Creed and the trilogy of call of Duty: modern war were completed. The mysterious sea area ushered in a new chapter of the legend, and the birth of the masterpiece ancient scroll 5. In front of such a luxurious lineup, for an original new work, if there is no eye-catching flash point, it is difficult to stand out from it. There are many victims buried by the best works, and the fury produced by id software is undoubtedly the most impressive one.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun Waste punk FPS rage, simple, direct and powerless/c0a7cbf8ec81453dbb08f748d4bb8d5b.jpg" alt="Is this game fun Waste punk FPS rage, simple, direct and powerless"><br>In May this year, fury ushered in its sequel after eight years. Because the previous work didn’t make much waves at that time, the publisher Bethesda promoted it as a key project. People who are familiar with id software know that their family focuses on producing all kinds of refreshing classic FPS games, and Bethesda also focuses on this point and makes great efforts Potential. There was a time when almost all the game circles were full of advertisements for this game. Many players chose to start with it out of curiosity. After the game was actually released, it didn’t seem to meet the expectations of the players.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun Waste punk FPS rage, simple, direct and powerless/eb6954504b2d43f9b617cdfb33e367a0.jpg" alt="Is this game fun Waste punk FPS rage, simple, direct and powerless"></p>
<h1 id="waste-punk"><a href="#waste-punk" class="headerlink" title="waste punk"></a>waste punk</h1><p>Speaking of the word “wasteland”, it’s hard for some qualified players not to think of a post apocalyptic movie called crazy max. if a wasteland game doesn’t learn some elements from this movie, it must be lying. Although the game works with the theme of waste land are not new, everyone knows what they are. In fact, there are not too many players who are really interested in it, which is not a special minority type. In this kind of works, RPG game “radiation” series is taken as the representative to create a postwar world full of black humor for the players, but in fact, for the real junkyard fans, it seems that a little punk element is more meaningful. The first generation of rage released in 2011 is such a work. Unlike other games of the same theme, the wasteland of rage is the world destroyed after the earth was hit by an asteroid, rather than the past post-war or virus outbreak, which makes people feel fresh.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun Waste punk FPS rage, simple, direct and powerless/0af898364b6841e8996e95c7ab65fcca.jpg" alt="Is this game fun Waste punk FPS rage, simple, direct and powerless"><br>In order to continue civilization, human beings have selected a group of elites with outstanding abilities and good genes to join in a plan called “Ark”. They are put into a sleeping cabin that can withstand disasters, and can wake up again after the disaster is sad (another “old Popsicle”). After the disaster, the world has not been completely destroyed by asteroids. Some people have survived, some have built settlements to survive together, and some have become lawless vagrants who do evil everywhere. Players will play one of the elites in the “Ark” plan and take risks in this new world. It is worth mentioning that, as a game of 2011, the first generation of “fury” will still make people think that the screen performance of the game is excellent even if it is played now. When the famous media ign’s game evaluation and single score were given, it also gave a full score for the screen of the game. Its game body has a capacity of 25g, which was called by many media at that time “Hardware killer”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun Waste punk FPS rage, simple, direct and powerless/d829c0efee294fe780f2c1e212dad0a3.jpg" alt="Is this game fun Waste punk FPS rage, simple, direct and powerless"><br>Thanks to the FPS development experience of id software, the internal score of the game is very meaningful, which can fully experience the pleasure of “shooting and exploding”. The weapon is also a combination of science magic wind and waste earth wind. Combined with fast-paced action system and various props, the player can easily play a flowing and gorgeous operation in the game. And since it contains punk elements, how can you not have a cool car like crazy max? The car is an essential thing for players in the game. It can be used as a tool for walking or carrying all kinds of powerful weapons to fight. You can drive it on the waste soil, or you can have a passionate race with other waste customers. From NPC, enemies, and game background, there is a strong smell of junky punk. At present, it can’t be a thunder work, but who can expect that id software still messed him up.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun Waste punk FPS rage, simple, direct and powerless/0287e2336c364155831ac1553f1636ee.jpg" alt="Is this game fun Waste punk FPS rage, simple, direct and powerless"><br>   weakness<br>The main content of players in the game is to receive tasks, drive, fight and return to hand in tasks. Each task location has been made into a separate linear process area. Some tasks even make you walk the previously passed level again in reverse. The battle of the simple game is better, or the players will be bored soon. John kamak, a talented programmer of id software, once said: FPS is like a small adult movie. The plot can be but is not necessary. Fury has a very perfect story background, but there is almost no sense of existence in the plot performance, and the ending is very hasty. It’s like the story suddenly stops in half, and many things are not reasonable Explain that I have some doubts now that John kamak’s reason for saying this is probably because they lack the ability to tell a good story. Since they have designed the plot and world view for the game, they should tell a story with a head and a tail, and the unexpected ending makes many players think that it may be just a semi-finished product.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun Waste punk FPS rage, simple, direct and powerless/ffa74c9f569f40efab3933e20bd9baae.jpg" alt="Is this game fun Waste punk FPS rage, simple, direct and powerless"><br>Fury has many problems, but it is undoubtedly a potential stock. If it is revised, it may become a quite excellent game, so the players put this expectation on the sequel. For eight years, fury 2, released this year, publicized the violent aesthetic elements of the game in the early stage of its release, claiming to create a wasteland world as irascible as the name of the game. The main tone of the game is yellow, pink and purple. Combined with its original sci-fi background, the game has a kind of “cyberpunk” flavor in special effects and visual effects. It’s like a game called “island crisis: Blood dragon” once made by Ubisoft. People who are used to seeing this visual effect may feel OK, but more people will only think it’s like some light pollution.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun Waste punk FPS rage, simple, direct and powerless/6733fd7fe7604f5a843b4726f791c90a.jpg" alt="Is this game fun Waste punk FPS rage, simple, direct and powerless"><br>Fury 2 has changed the game into an open world design for the first time, and it has a new and powerful wasteland world. Unfortunately, this open world is the same as Ubisoft’s formula open world. Although it is big, it has no value to explore. The only element that can get a hand in this work is naturally an excellent over head combat system. Thanks to the development of the game, the avalanche studio that makes “self defense” series participates in it. If we simply play it as a “shooting explosion” game like “destroyer”, we can get a good experience. For an open world shooting game, only This is obviously not enough. As always, the plot is plain and nonexistent, and the main line flow is short, and the branch line tasks have no impact on the game flow. It seems that rage 2 not only learns the way of formulaic open world in a decent way, but also learns from the plot short board of the next house together with the task design and even the bug.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Is this game fun Waste punk FPS rage, simple, direct and powerless/c897c943c3944eb0ae70de06380f4550.jpg" alt="Is this game fun Waste punk FPS rage, simple, direct and powerless"><br>    concluding remarks<br>It seems to have a rigorous world view, but the weak plot design is the game tradition of id software. Even the games like “destroyer” and “German headquarters” have similar problems. The design of “fury” is obviously the head of a hundred families, so it should have a good performance. With its unique crisp fighting, it should not have become a work with poor public praise, Maybe only the players who are interested in the wasteland theme and also like the classic FPS game can enjoy it. If there is one item that can’t be satisfied, they are likely to be attracted by the short board in the game, thus leaving a bad impression on the game.</p>

    <title>Maybe it&#39;s a masterpiece. Is there a parallel universe in the game</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/Maybe%20it&#39;s%20a%20masterpiece.%20Is%20there%20a%20parallel%20universe%20in%20the%20game/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Matt walker, the producer of “ghost sob 5”, the last most powerful act game in Pingcheng, said in a media interview that as a developer, he was very willing to develop the sequel of “DMC: Ghost sob”. He thought he would have the opportunity to cooperate with Ninja theory (NT), the original developer, but unfortunately, the plan has not been able to make progress. He hopes to see one A sequel, and this sequel must be made by NT. Without NT, it can’t be called “DMC: Ghost cry”.<br>It can be seen that Capcom’s evaluation of “DMC: Ghost cry” is quite high, even the producers of “ghost cry” series are able to give a very high evaluation, but unfortunately, the NT that developed “DMC: Ghost cry” has been acquired by Microsoft, and the sequel has become another “lifetime” series.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Maybe it's a masterpiece. Is there a parallel universe in the game/2d653ace250e4778a764ecf4c7ba12ef.jpg" alt="Maybe it&#39;s a masterpiece. Is there a parallel universe in the game"><br>As we all know, the game quality of “DMC: Ghost cry” is not so bad as it is actually quite good. As an external work, its most criticized is that all kinds of settings have been directly overthrown. The simplification of the combat system also makes many old fans of the series think that it can not be called “ghost cry”. In fact, in the game circle, there are many other “parallel universe” works based on the well-known game IP, such as “DMC: Ghost cry”. Although the quality of the game itself is not bad, the players may not be able to accept the changes of the original IP, but in fact, as long as these prejudices are put down and the works are tasted carefully, they may also reap unexpected surprises.</p>
<h1 id="not-recognized-“DMC-Ghost-cry”"><a href="#not-recognized-“DMC-Ghost-cry”" class="headerlink" title="not recognized “DMC: Ghost cry”"></a>not recognized “DMC: Ghost cry”</h1><p>Let’s talk about why DMC, the illegitimate child, is criticized by players.<br>As early as after the release of ghost cry 4, the series’s protagonist may have caused a lot of criticism from Dante to Nero, which led Capcom to put the IP on hold for five years. No one thought that five years later, Capcom brought back a “Dante” who no one knew to appear in front of the players: the new Dante looks like a street gangster, the setting of the human devil hybrid has also become a hybrid of angels and demons, the iconic white long hair has also become a black inch head, and the age is similar to the youngest Dante in “sobs 3”.<br>I don’t know what Capcom thinks. If it’s really because of the four generations of protagonists, then why has it changed most of the game’s settings so dramatically?<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Maybe it's a masterpiece. Is there a parallel universe in the game/8ef5ef448f9747a290d63b337b29b1ea.jpg" alt="Maybe it&#39;s a masterpiece. Is there a parallel universe in the game"><br>The first Dante was more like a hooligan and eventually changed<br>So as a series of restart, how about the quality of the game? NT, the developer of DMC, is also a famous act game developer in the industry. It represents the act game Xuantian Shenjian, which has the title of “female version of Zhanshen”.<br>“Xuantian sword” has won a lot of praise by relying on precise and real character movements and pictures, which is also well reflected in “DMC”. The consistency of new Dante’s fighting movements is better than that of the previous one, and the whole is closer to the real human movements. However, in view of the original version of “ghost cry” which takes the sense of attack and battle score as the soul, there is no slack in the new work, although the game The operation should be simpler, but with the seamless switching of various weapons, the depth of continuous moves is still intact, and the overall combat experience is almost the same as the original version.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Maybe it's a masterpiece. Is there a parallel universe in the game/566531808cae4983b3685c2ea77288b1.jpg" alt="Maybe it&#39;s a masterpiece. Is there a parallel universe in the game"><br>Xuantian divine sword with oriental flavor<br>As mentioned above, Capcom himself said that this is a story of “parallel universe” based on the original. The purpose of doing this is that they want to restart the whole series in a different way, but it can be seen from the external reaction that they don’t seem to buy it. What players really want is “ghost cry 5”, which can also be reflected in the reports of various media. At that time, many media simply called “DMC” as “ghost cry 5”, and even many pirated resources after the sale of the game were directly named “ghost cry 5”, which is also proved by the extremely high download volume.<br>Although the media evaluation of the game is very high, the great change of the style leads to the fact that the work is not considerable in the reputation of the players. The sales volume is only more than half of that of “ghost cry 4”. However, as long as the players have played, they will give a similar evaluation: if it is not called “ghost cry”, it is actually a very excellent work.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Maybe it's a masterpiece. Is there a parallel universe in the game/b2f326ce34a84527be7aebec070050cb.jpg" alt="Maybe it&#39;s a masterpiece. Is there a parallel universe in the game"><br>The battle rating of “ghost cry” series features is also reserved</p>
<p>#Birth is the guilty “alloy gear: survival”<br>After Xiaodao Xiufu, the ace producer, left Konami, who could have thought that Konami had produced a new work alloy equipment: survival, the theme of zombie survival, the author, as an old fan of alloy equipment series, could not understand this situation. Don’t ask you to be able to make the game that surpasses the previous one, at least it must be similar. How did you change from tactical espionage game to zombie game? I believe that no one can accept this change. Once this work is published, it can be said that it has gained a lot of scolding. There are not a few people who hold the same view with the author.<br>The first “alloy equipment” game without Xiaodao Xiufu was produced by Jiao youer, the former chief programmer of Xiaodao studio. He has participated in the development of several “MGS” and is a real backbone member beside Xiaodao. It’s Jiao youer who often conflicts with Xiaodao due to his different ideas. When Xiaodao left with most members of the studio, he chose to stay. Maybe he is the most qualified person to take over the series, which makes people feel happy or helpless.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Maybe it's a masterpiece. Is there a parallel universe in the game/68049b6b1c2b4d02b24170960ecc8595.jpg" alt="Maybe it&#39;s a masterpiece. Is there a parallel universe in the game"><br>As early as before the game was released, I was lucky to take my friends to participate in the beta test of the game with the mentality of testing water, but after experiencing the online content of many people in the game, I couldn’t help saying “really fragrant”. The multiplayer mode in the game is basically the trend of shooting corpses at guard points in the traditional zombie game. In the game, players can use various knives, guns, sticks, guns and explosives to fight. At the same time, there is a simple construction system that can set up various walls and mechanisms to resist the attack of zombies, and can use various methods to hang zombies. In general, TPS game adds tower defense, As a zombie game, it is qualified, not only qualified.<br>After the sale, due to the low price, the author chose to buy one. The single player part of the game is a relatively hard core survival game. Players need to explore the open world with the process. In this process, you need to collect resources to make a living, build equipment construction base, and manage peers to resist attacks. In general, the game is very rich in playing methods, The setting of each system also explains the theme of “survival”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Maybe it's a masterpiece. Is there a parallel universe in the game/b8193da9232847a0bdf68540eb7a4f3f.jpg" alt="Maybe it&#39;s a masterpiece. Is there a parallel universe in the game"><br>If you’ve played tower defense game “orcs must die”, the combat system should be able to work quickly<br>Although you will feel that the operation, UI and even material of the game are very similar to his predecessor “phantom pain” (because it is the same engine), but in the actual game process, if you don’t watch the game, you won’t even remember that the game you play is called “alloy equipment”.<br>The plot of the game is based on the parallel universe on the same parallel time line of phantom pain. The opening game itself said, “maybe the story will develop like this, another wild history”. It is clear that this is a piece level external biography game that can not be compared with the one being made. However, from the perspective of gameplay and interest, the game is not as bad as the media said, but it has one One of the same problems with “DMC: Ghost cry” is that he carries the title of “alloy equipment”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Maybe it's a masterpiece. Is there a parallel universe in the game/25a899d41402453dbf792712821f0ce5.jpg" alt="Maybe it&#39;s a masterpiece. Is there a parallel universe in the game"><br>Most of the materials are directly used in the previous work phantom pain<br>This work is a test of water. I think even without komani, the production level of komani is not going to drop. Although this work is still a little short of polish and unsatisfactory in general, it is not the reason why he should be criticized. Undoubtedly, alloy equipment series has been a fan oriented game. Every generation of alloy equipment Four fifths of the sales volume is contributed by the fans of Hideki shimajima. There is no doubt about the talent and charm of Hideki shimajima, but it’s terrible that a game series is regarded as the personal work of Hideki shimajima by the fans. The strength and efforts of the development team and the whole company behind it are completely ignored, which makes people wonder whether they like alloy equipment or small Shimao Xiufu, the most innocent victim of “alloy equipment: survival” born in this lamentable environment.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Maybe it's a masterpiece. Is there a parallel universe in the game/31f55150fb7e4e5a86b53c349a98c088.jpg" alt="Maybe it&#39;s a masterpiece. Is there a parallel universe in the game"><br>Multiplayer part can improve playability again<br>    concluding remarks<br>A lot of times, we can’t help but see that our favorite works are made by developers. Sometimes, they may end up playing bad by developers, but they can’t be changed even better. In the final analysis, the evaluation of a game should be based on the game itself. Bad games naturally need to be sprayed instead. If you don’t like a big deal, you can’t buy or play it. However, many good games are attacked indiscriminately because of many other factors, and even a lot of people who follow the trend are not able to pass. This is not what a player who loves the game should look like. The player who plays the game chart is happy. The game is fun enough. The so-called “lost soul” cloud in the game evaluation has no reference value. After all, no game will bring “salvation” to the player.</p>

    <title>Nearly 60 platforms in 35 years, why is Tetris at the top of the game field</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/Nearly%2060%20platforms%20in%2035%20years,%20why%20is%20Tetris%20at%20the%20top%20of%20the%20game%20field/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In 1984, a researcher from the Soviet Union developed a small game for testing computer performance, but it has an extremely addictive effect. As long as the game does not fail, it can be played continuously. Even many game masters can hardly reveal the reason. They only know that the game can make people play without stopping.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Nearly 60 platforms in 35 years, why is Tetris at the top of the game field/ebb6577399b84fefb613f6a55496a0a4.jpg" alt="Nearly 60 platforms in 35 years, why is Tetris at the top of the game field"><br>Don’t think I’m joking. What kind of fairy game do you think it is? In fact, it’s just Tetris that everyone knows. “Tetris” is just a small game, but its sales volume can be said to be quite terrifying. It is called “the game with the highest sales volume in the history of games”, and no one has surpassed this title until now.</p>
<h1 id="kill-time"><a href="#kill-time" class="headerlink" title="kill time"></a>kill time</h1><p>The story happened in the 1980s, when the Soviet Union had not disintegrated. Alexei Pajitnov, a mathematical genius, joined the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union. Under the influence of the Soviet government, almost every child had to learn computer since childhood. The purpose was to attract these young people to join the government and become a scientist or an engineer Lexer is one of many people. Alexei’s character is relatively straightforward and entertaining. When he is free, he likes to tell a joke with his friends. It’s not easy for such a person to do a very boring job repeatedly every day. The work of the research institute is not only boring, but also not spacious. It often requires several people to share a table and a machine, so he often loses things About the West. In order to avoid this situation, Alexei takes the initiative to work overtime in the research institute every day, just for the sake that his things will not be “cleared away”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Nearly 60 platforms in 35 years, why is Tetris at the top of the game field/6f0c7e8d48a546de8721b2581250f33d.jpg" alt="Nearly 60 platforms in 35 years, why is Tetris at the top of the game field"><br>Alexei Pajitnov, father of Tetris<br>Later, the research institute updated the equipment and changed to electornika 60, a computer made by the Soviet Union to imitate Dec LSI-11 of the United States, which can only display text instead of graphics. With the “new toy”, anyone wants to have a good time. Alexei, who is active and restless, also has such an idea. His idea is even more exaggerated. He wants to make a game with this computer so that he can spend his time after work. Alexei is not the only one who has this idea. Because of his love for programming, Alexei got to know two other programmers: Dimitri Pavlovski and Vadim grahimov. With the participation of others, they decided to let the game not only spend their time after work, but also get it to the market Selling money can not only entertain but also earn extra money. Isn’t it nice to kill two birds with one stone?<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Nearly 60 platforms in 35 years, why is Tetris at the top of the game field/0bbae73f59214e42a2f069fc6bd628d2.jpg" alt="Nearly 60 platforms in 35 years, why is Tetris at the top of the game field"><br>Electornika 60 computer</p>
<h1 id="more-fun-than-toys"><a href="#more-fun-than-toys" class="headerlink" title="more fun than toys"></a>more fun than toys</h1><p>In the 1940s, a kind of educational toy was very popular both at home and abroad. It was called “twelve pieces of puzzle” in China. It was a kind of board game. It was composed of twelve pieces of wood with different shapes, and each piece was composed of five small cubes, so it was also called “five pieces of bone”. These twelve pieces of wood can form a variety of patterns. The most popular way to play with them is to try to put them into a rectangular base plate. You will find that you need to use your brain to put all the pieces into the base plate. The design of this game involves five or six kinds of mathematics subjects, such as geometry and topology. It is researched by scholars in various fields at home and abroad, so it is highly praised by mathematicians.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Nearly 60 platforms in 35 years, why is Tetris at the top of the game field/65dc5a9b977845e488fce88aa6551ba9.jpg" alt="Nearly 60 platforms in 35 years, why is Tetris at the top of the game field"><br>The classic puzzle game “mind boggling twelve pieces”<br>Alexei liked this puzzle toy very much when he was a child, so he thought of making a game similar to this toy, but the number of texts that can be displayed by computer is limited, and there are only rectangles in text characters, so Alexei reduced the number of rectangles of each graph from five to four, and reduced the number of graphs to seven and grouped them with rectangles Close to a square. The development cycle of the game is not long. It took only six days to complete. But after the game was made, they found a problem: because of the deletion of various contents, the difficulty of the game is extremely simple, basically only need to crack once, there is no suspense, no challenge and playability, so Alexei can only modify the game, and the direction of modification is the game Rules.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Nearly 60 platforms in 35 years, why is Tetris at the top of the game field/30aa21785ddc43b4be3fcb51e8ab1c53.jpg" alt="Nearly 60 platforms in 35 years, why is Tetris at the top of the game field"><br>Only seven patterns left<br>Alexei changed the rules of the game to seven different shapes of patterns falling from the top of the screen to the bottom of the screen in a limited area in a random order. Players can control the position and direction of these patterns when they fall, and fill the whole area by continuously splicing these patterns. And if it’s full, the game is over. Although it’s exciting, it can’t give the players the motivation to challenge. So Alexei modifies the rules of the game again. When the small squares that make up the pattern can fill a whole line, they will be eliminated and fall a line, so that the players can keep playing until the pattern is stacked to the top of the screen Bundle.<br>In this way, the thrill and playability of the game are improved. The endless playing methods are a little bit addictive. The final product makes Alexei unable to stop playing. This game doesn’t even need a tutorial. Anyone can easily play it. Alexei named this game Tetris, which is a representative number in Greek Word 4 “TetR” is a combination of his favorite sport, “tennis.”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Nearly 60 platforms in 35 years, why is Tetris at the top of the game field/66a4d311c96a439bbaa03a355d49b4da.jpg" alt="Nearly 60 platforms in 35 years, why is Tetris at the top of the game field"><br>The first Tetris in history</p>

For the reason of space, the author will only elaborate here. Interested friends can watch the documentary “the story of Tetris” produced by the famous broadcaster “game historian”. What we need to know is that in the same period, “Tetris” is a hot cake among many game manufacturers, because it is very addictive. It seems that whoever can get the copyright of this game can make a lot of money in an instant. The game first became popular in Alexei’s Research Institute for a while, then the whole Soviet Union, and spread to other countries through many trade personnel who often go abroad. Finally, Nintendo took the lead in winning the distribution right and sold the game with the same model of game boy. In a short time, it achieved a very terrible sales volume of 35 million sets.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Nearly 60 platforms in 35 years, why is Tetris at the top of the game field/be6b2729f9b0422ba1034d7846c2ead3.jpg" alt="Nearly 60 platforms in 35 years, why is Tetris at the top of the game field"><br>GB Tetris<br>Since then, this “toxic” game has been recognized by people all over the world. Under the guidance of Nintendo, it has landed on many platforms. Up to now, it has logged on nearly 60 different platforms in total, and has made considerable sales in each platform. Over time, this easy-to-use game has also launched many different versions, adding many novel settings, such as VR version of Tetris: effect, and the linkage version of the famous puzzle game “poopoopoopoopoop vs. Tetris”, and even at the beginning of this year, Nintendo ns platform launched support for 99 people in the same screen competition “Eat chicken” version of “Tetris 99”, some games are free, some are expensive, even so, “Tetris” still made a very amazing sales, according to ign statistics of overseas well-known media, as of April this year, the total sales volume of “Tetris” reached 500 million, only followed by “my world” is 154 million.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Nearly 60 platforms in 35 years, why is Tetris at the top of the game field/9845fc0f0f90405991b92bbdf7258005.jpg" alt="Nearly 60 platforms in 35 years, why is Tetris at the top of the game field"><br>Ign statistics<br>End of<br>Since it is so popular, Alexei, who invented the game, must be a rich man now, right? In fact, the game was born in the Scientific Research Institute of the Soviet Union, so the copyright of the game should be owned by the government. After several twists and turns, the Russian government didn’t return the copyright of the game to him until eleven years after the game had been on the market. At that time, “Tetris” had already passed his most beautiful time, but Alexei still relied on it The game has made a lot of money and continues to this day.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Nearly 60 platforms in 35 years, why is Tetris at the top of the game field/be3d24caf48340fabff2526c675490e1.jpg" alt="Nearly 60 platforms in 35 years, why is Tetris at the top of the game field"><br>Tesla modle s of Alexei, with the license plate of Tetris<br>The invincible story of Tetris is still going on. Now it’s the 35th idea of Tetris. Alexei is also a 63 year old uncle, but he still has enough capital and conditions to stand out. Media once asked him, “do you think people will continue to play your game in a hundred years?” Alexei’s answer is yes. The reason is that no matter how many years have passed, the nature and nature of human brain will not change greatly. Chess has been played for thousands of years and people are not happy. Happiness is very important for human beings. As long as people can feel happiness from the game, it will not change for many years (Tetris) It will be out of date.</p>

    <title>Legend of fairyland ro guarding the eternal love just for a more pure game experience</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/Legend%20of%20fairyland%20ro%20guarding%20the%20eternal%20love%20just%20for%20a%20more%20pure%20game%20experience/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Looking at all kinds of popular mobile games nowadays, it is not difficult to find many works adapted based on old classic IP. They may have been popular IP, or they may have been little known cold IP. But it is undeniable that IP adapted mobile games provide a new opportunity for these hot and cold works.<br>Let’s take a closer look at these games. It’s not hard to find that these games have very different designs. If we look at the core element of “IP adaptation” from what perspective, what kind of works will be produced. Obviously, the perspective of many manufacturers on the market is about the same position, and the game “Legend of fairyland ro: guarding eternal love” (hereinafter referred to as RO) seems to have some unique views from the beginning.<br>Nostalgic but not backward<br>From a long time ago, when large-scale online games began to prevail in the domestic game market, various manufacturers designed different styles of game works for different people. Some people like the magic and realistic style of European and American end tour, some people like the martial arts and immortal style of domestic end tour, and some people like the fresh cartoon style of Japan and South Korea end tour. No matter what the style is, the game system is always biased towards the hard core. Since there is no essential difference in the system, it is necessary to make a judgment from the personal perception. No one has ever said that people who like hard core games will not like the style of cartoon, like is like, there is no limit and no reason.<br>It’s just to see that in RO, all the elements that once carried players’ full memories are preserved. No matter the monsters that players have fought with or the partners who have fought with them, they are all reappeared in a more gorgeous 3D form, which neither loses feelings nor makes people feel disconnected from the world.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Legend of fairyland ro guarding the eternal love just for a more pure game experience/d8d60581158e431992b5b3b25a65e165.jpg" alt="Legend of fairyland ro guarding the eternal love just for a more pure game experience"><br>Most of the large-scale end game IP transplanted to mobile platform will greatly cut down the content of the game in order to adapt to the rhythm of conventional mobile games, and only keep the core part. Although it improves the utilization of player’s fragment time, it can’t achieve a very good game experience. Old IP fans don’t want to enter the pit, and new players don’t care about it.<br>But “ro” didn’t compromise the content of the game because of logging into the mobile terminal. Compared with other greatly simplified adapted mobile games, the overall process of RO is relatively slow, and the upgrade process is relatively long. This is the intention of the developers, so that the players can have time to experience the interesting content outside the main line process, so that the players will not feel bored during the adventure process because of the long upgrade process. Perhaps in the eyes of most players, “ro” is not a very friendly game for new players, nor is it particularly easy to find out how to operate the system. It seems that the threshold is very high, but this is not the problem of “ro”, but the whole game market in China has been lowered by those over simplified fast-food games, which makes “ro” a high threshold.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Legend of fairyland ro guarding the eternal love just for a more pure game experience/9e5e1657ba874b9ead91ee7b110a5df4.jpg" alt="Legend of fairyland ro guarding the eternal love just for a more pure game experience"><br>The meaning of the game<br>We all know that playing games is to have fun. Of course, everyone has different ways to have fun. Among the current categories of video games, the most popular is naturally competitive games. As the saying goes, “it’s fun to fight with people”. In the ordinary domestic mobile games, social elements will be weakened as much as possible. Basically, there is no other social element except a ranking system and an invite friend system. This is because some players like to immerse themselves in the superiority of defeating other players, but in general, players will have strong frustration as long as they fail Feeling, it’s OK to win. If you lose again and again, you will angrily delete the game and scold the game rubbish. The player can’t experience the fun, and the game itself will also carry the unnecessary scolding. What’s the trouble? I always have a point: if a game makes you uncomfortable to play, what’s the reason to play it?<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Legend of fairyland ro guarding the eternal love just for a more pure game experience/22710b785d7a4868876066c53780a128.jpg" alt="Legend of fairyland ro guarding the eternal love just for a more pure game experience"><br>Even in MMORPG games, many players often miss the most interesting content of the game in pursuit of utility. They only care about how much reward they can give to complete the task, what advanced equipment they can give, and how to upgrade quickly. But think about it carefully. It seems that no one has stipulated that they must give corresponding experience and Money, no one stipulates to play MMORPG must also become the strongest game.<br>In RO, the reward of many tasks may be an action, a character expression, a good-looking dress, or the interesting experience deliberately designed by the task itself is the reward for the players. Some people may not understand. What’s the point of giving these things? So let’s turn the question around: does it have to be meaningful to play games? It’s back to the beginning. Isn’t it just fun to play games?<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Legend of fairyland ro guarding the eternal love just for a more pure game experience/b96d7a2abcd6465894cb36c412e2772b.jpg" alt="Legend of fairyland ro guarding the eternal love just for a more pure game experience"><br>Ro’s positioning is a leisure MMORPG. Although there are combat systems, skills and occupations that need to be studied with a little attention in the game, they also need to consider themselves according to the style of play, but fighting is not the whole game, and fighting is only moderate and necessary. Players can explore the world at will like a real adventurer in the game. It doesn’t matter if they don’t fight. There are many interesting contents waiting for players to explore outside the only way of the map. Some people complain about why there is no automatic way finding in the game, and it’s very difficult to find a NPC and run on its own. However, many games on the market used to be this way. The reason why there is no such design is to let the players remember the world by themselves, so as to improve the sense of substitution in the game, just like reading novels is spoiled by people, and the sense of freshness will be greatly reduced.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Legend of fairyland ro guarding the eternal love just for a more pure game experience/947c87ef2b474bb986ed6e3ab30afcba.jpg" alt="Legend of fairyland ro guarding the eternal love just for a more pure game experience"><br>Tail: renew leading edge<br>“After the test, once depressed can cry, the most real smile can be seen.” Every old player of “ro” should be familiar with this “dream sky”. For ordinary people, Stefanie Sun, the author of this song, may be just an excellent pop musician. For old players of “ro”, she will always be the “music Wizard” in the world of “ro”, enriching their youth together with “ro”. Considering everything, no matter how classic other elements are, Sun Yanzi, the music wizard, will never be more impressive to the players. So in the RO tour, Sun Yanzi is lucky to return and interact with the players as the music wizard again. After 16 years, players can open a new adventure story with Stefanie Sun and pursue her music growth.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Legend of fairyland ro guarding the eternal love just for a more pure game experience/c09412ff2dcc4109b37e3113a0728fe6.jpg" alt="Legend of fairyland ro guarding the eternal love just for a more pure game experience"><br>It can be seen that in terms of arousing the memories of the old players, the legend of fairyland ro: guarding the eternal love is a good effort. In general, RO is a pure stream in today’s impetuous and materialistic game environment. It’s not like a hand game at all. Ro is absolutely excellent in restoring the end game experience. Over the years, developers have been constantly listening to the voice of the players and making appropriate modifications to the game. I sincerely hope that this game can achieve long-term success. After all, there are not many teams who can make a game with such a heart. However, players who have experienced this game carefully should be able to feel it more or less. They really are Making a “game” instead of a “krypton tool”.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>Speaking of the game produced in Poland, it is estimated that most people will think of the wizard series for the first time. As a national treasure of Poland, the name of the developer cdpr “Polish donkey” may be more popular than their real name. In fact, although there are not many works of the same quality as “Wizard” in Poland, there are many excellent and well-known works, such as the classic strategy game “this is my war”, the perfect combination of Parkour and zombie fighting “vanishing light” and so on, which are all created by Polish game developers.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Night man the owner who can't open a shop is not a good brave man, bringing new enlightenment to independent games/a541ea95eb8745ffa4fa5dd7ab222495.jpg" alt="Night man the owner who can&#39;t open a shop is not a good brave man, bringing new enlightenment to independent games"><br>In addition to cdpr, the most famous independent game company is 11bit, and the most impressive game product that their company has recently launched is rougelite game, which is called “night watcher”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Night man the owner who can't open a shop is not a good brave man, bringing new enlightenment to independent games/51d735c8fe5f459cb23bc55ea3bb2cd9.jpg" alt="Night man the owner who can&#39;t open a shop is not a good brave man, bringing new enlightenment to independent games"></p>
<h1 id="open-shop-in-the-daytime-and-explore-in-the-evening"><a href="#open-shop-in-the-daytime-and-explore-in-the-evening" class="headerlink" title="open shop in the daytime and explore in the evening"></a>open shop in the daytime and explore in the evening</h1><p>A long time ago, the author wrote a novel about a young sailor who was born as a pirate who was attacked by storms and sea monsters in the process of going back to sea. His ship was destroyed. However, the young sailor was rushed to a new continent which had not been recorded on the map by the storm. Because of his disconnection from the outside world, he could only settle here temporarily A new continent. By chance, he got a note that once belonged to an explorer, in which he recorded the experiences of various legends and legends of various treasures. Then, out of the instinct of pirates, he began to explore the new continent. With more and more treasures, he was helpless in order to hide his identity as a treasure hunter A small town in the new world has opened a grocery store, displaying all the treasures in the store. Whoever buys these treasures will not sell them. So in his spare time or in the quiet of the night, he went out to search for treasures. When people in the small town had many eyes, he stayed in the shop and looked at these treasures. The story revolved around the treasure hunter and every “close friend” who visited the shop.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Night man the owner who can't open a shop is not a good brave man, bringing new enlightenment to independent games/081824c197404ecdba88aacd994eba31.jpg" alt="Night man the owner who can&#39;t open a shop is not a good brave man, bringing new enlightenment to independent games"><br>“Night man” is such a novel with some similarities. The player will play a young boss in the game. He needs to take care of the grocery store which has been passed down for several generations. The commodities on the shelf are all kinds of spoils that the protagonist gets every night when he goes to the dungeon to fight against monsters. In short, the mode atmosphere of the game is divided into two stages. The content of the day-to-day shop is the simulation operation, while the night adventure is the dungeon ARPG with rougelite elements, and the name of “Moonlight” comes from this. In fact, although the design of the combination of management and RPG seems very novel, it has been used in games for a long time. The most representative work is “lucitia: a magic recipe for props house management” produced by Japanese game studio easygamestation in 2007. As a boss and a brave adventurer, he can not only sell money, but also strengthen his own weapons and equipment. Therefore, players with dual identities usually need to think about “money” and “power”, which is the core idea of the game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Night man the owner who can't open a shop is not a good brave man, bringing new enlightenment to independent games/cae702693f034b5a92a7fe0c478394b6.jpg" alt="Night man the owner who can&#39;t open a shop is not a good brave man, bringing new enlightenment to independent games"><br>Lucitia: the best way to manage props house</p>
<h1 id="first-battle-won"><a href="#first-battle-won" class="headerlink" title="first battle won"></a>first battle won</h1><p>Although the game “night man” was released by the famous 11bit, it was developed by an unknown game company, and the game was also their first original work. The company’s name is digital sun, and now there are about 30 people. In fact, only six people participate in the production of this game. Because digital sun is not only a game development department, but also mainly responsible for outsourcing services before the production of “night man”. The main business of the whole company is to produce mobile games and advertising games, and occasionally undertake some game demo framework building Construction work, and “night man” is just one of their company’s many plans.<br>The company has been established for more than six years, and they always insist on doing these works. Anyway, they are also a game development team, and they certainly want to make an original work of their own. For a long time, several core members of the company are often busy and idle, and several people sit together to discuss and do some creative work. In this case, the “night man” is composed of countless people One day, they realized that it might not be difficult to play such a game. Within their capacity, they may have the opportunity to do it seriously.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Night man the owner who can't open a shop is not a good brave man, bringing new enlightenment to independent games/f7521c26b74e4308a65f277cbbae892e.jpg" alt="Night man the owner who can&#39;t open a shop is not a good brave man, bringing new enlightenment to independent games"><br>Game design materials<br>For a company that undertakes outsourcing work all the year round, since it wants to do original work, the first condition is to have money, and the company’s income for many years can only meet the basic normal operation of the company, only a little savings can be used for investment, so a very common operation in the independent game circle appears: the company has opened crowdfunding on KickStarter, with a goal of 4 Ten thousand dollars. The company put some set materials and content on the crowdfunding page to show the type of game to the players, hoping to get the attention of other interested players. However, it didn’t realize that the game received a total of $134000 from 5229 supporters in a month, which far exceeded the company’s expectation. The game received KickStarter support Hold, has a higher exposure than other products, at the same time, the name of the game is also gradually spread among many players, so that the reputation of the game has been growing.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Night man the owner who can't open a shop is not a good brave man, bringing new enlightenment to independent games/22d82beef0cc41569e990d5a0daeb787.jpg" alt="Night man the owner who can&#39;t open a shop is not a good brave man, bringing new enlightenment to independent games"><br>Game crowdfunding interface<br>Up to now, this work has more than 4000 reviews on steam, of which the praise rate is about 80%, and the sales volume of this work on the whole platform has exceeded 500000. In short, although the work adopting this unique game mode is not the first one of “night watchman”, it is very rare in European and American game circles and even in the whole independent game circles. There are many players who like to fight in dungeons, and there are not a few who like to open a shop slowly. If we combine the two, it can be called “double” happiness, plus the work in the war The Dou part adopts rougelite mechanism, and the picture chooses the pixel wind which is more friendly to the people. There is a feeling of “dreaming back GBA” in the overall appearance, so it is difficult not to spread in this not too big circle.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Night man the owner who can't open a shop is not a good brave man, bringing new enlightenment to independent games/7864f8032975432aadf73482685b654f.jpg" alt="Night man the owner who can&#39;t open a shop is not a good brave man, bringing new enlightenment to independent games"><br>    concluding remarks<br>Digital sun’s first battle is over, and it has made great achievements. The appearance of the “night man” also brings new enlightenment to the independent game development field: the development of independent game is a field that requires creativity to achieve success. After all, it has no high investment or high cost, and it can’t rely on hard technology like 3A game to add more points, even if it doesn’t What’s a good idea? If we combine the existing game types organically with a good setting, it can also present a bright effect. Digital sun’s success may seem easy, but in fact, it’s not just a chance to get lucky. Their outsourcing work has provided them with sufficient experience for many years. Javier Jimenez, CEO of the development team, said: it’s never easy to play games. Don’t underestimate the difficulty of the game. Even if you are engaged in other work, you should take your career seriously.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>On October 14, 2019, a big event happened in epic’s popular escape game “night of the fortress”: players stopped fighting one after another, set up high platforms in the game map and looked up at the sky. A rocket rises to the ground and rushes up into the night, blasting the sky with cracks like a dimension wall. Many unidentified meteorites and missiles constantly bombard the game world of “night of the fortress”. At last, all the incoming attacks gather in one place, causing a huge explosion and at the same time, a black hole is opened on the ground, and then everything you see is inhaled into it, including the player’s corner Color, then the game into the dark, leaving only a blue aperture in the center of the screen.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Night of the fortress was sucked away by a black hole. Players who wanted to play the game were so anxious/9053017c43784d44a7e089647338ae08.jpg" alt="Night of the fortress was sucked away by a black hole. Players who wanted to play the game were so anxious"><br>Players can’t start the game, only stare at the black screen stupidly, can’t start a new round of game, no matter how to restart, they can only see this picture. “Night of the fortress” was pushed from the official to the shopping mall. All the tweets and pictures were deleted, leaving only the black head and the same blue aperture as the game picture. Players familiar with “night of the fortress” should be aware that this is a regular activity in every season when the version of the game changes. Although players have long expected the official action, they did not expect this time to be so powerful.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Night of the fortress was sucked away by a black hole. Players who wanted to play the game were so anxious/3ca483be162c4ddc86ba776534938b87.jpg" alt="Night of the fortress was sucked away by a black hole.

<p>#I can’t stand it<br>Players can personally witness the destruction of the game world in the game, which is the first time in the whole game history. In the past Games, they usually add subtle changes to the game slowly, and the specific process is to rely on CG animation to express. Apart from “cool”, I can’t think of any other way to describe this activity. It’s obvious that this time, epic wants to meet the new map replacement of the next season in this way, so it’s a good way to attract players’ attention and make a very proper reason for the whole day’s downtime maintenance. For the game itself, it’s undoubtedly a good thing to welcome the big version update. But epic’s unexpected coming suddenly makes the players who are playing the game lose their eyes. The players don’t know when the event should start and end. It’s sad for many players who like this game. As of the time of writing, the live video of the event has been viewed on overseas YouTube websites for nearly 5 million times, and on twitch for nearly 2 million. Although the popularity of the game in China is not high, the upsurge in overseas is obvious to all.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Night of the fortress was sucked away by a black hole. Players who wanted to play the game were so anxious/6fae768673b24e06bdd38fb2b5899dd3.jpg" alt="Night of the fortress was sucked away by a black hole. Players who wanted to play the game were so anxious"><br>Dark official push<br>In foreign countries, many children, in a state of ignorance, found that they could not enter the game when they returned home and opened the game machine. They didn’t know whether the monitor was broken or the host was broken. Some of them were so angry that they jumped their feet and smashed the TV. Some of them were even more wronged to tears. Apart from children, even adults expressed their dissatisfaction with the event: “who would stare at such a black hole for hours?” Some people even wait until they fall asleep in front of the screen. They run to the official of epic to say that they want epic to play the game quickly, or they will go to the relevant authorities to sue them. In their opinion, after all, they spend money in this game, but they can’t play the game without money, which is no different from fraud. However, up to now, there are still tens of thousands of players sticking to the live broadcast room of “black hole”, staring at the aperture in the screen and expecting to change a little. No matter what kind of response this marketing campaign caused, at least in the current situation, epic’s goal is achieved.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Night of the fortress was sucked away by a black hole. Players who wanted to play the game were so anxious/30ccd44d73cf4a42b466924ec3bf29a3.jpg" alt="Night of the fortress was sucked away by a black hole. Players who wanted to play the game were so anxious"><br>“I came home from school and found you couldn’t play fortress night.”</p>
<h1 id="pay-and-return"><a href="#pay-and-return" class="headerlink" title="pay and return"></a>pay and return</h1><p>As I mentioned above, for players familiar with the game, these contents designed by epic in the game are not new. As early as the S9 season, there was a huge robot standing on the ground on the map of the game. With the slow progress of the whole season and gradual formation, it was not formally completed until the end of the season, At the same time, there are many traces left by giant monsters on the game map throughout the season, and it is not until the countdown to the end of the season officially ends that everything finally begins: the giant monsters rise from the sea, and the robots on the other side immediately attack the monsters. The battle between the two is imminent, and all players can play in the game world Watch the war in real time. This battle is very spectacular and has the feeling of “Pacific Rim”. In fact, this battle between robots and monsters really pays homage to “Pacific Rim” and ends with the victory of robots.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Night of the fortress was sucked away by a black hole. Players who wanted to play the game were so anxious/874aa94972384dc1b6a28174aa091d0a.jpg" alt="Night of the fortress was sucked away by a black hole. Players who wanted to play the game were so anxious"><br>The battle between robots and monsters<br>Not only “night of the fortress”, but also many other games have launched such “unidentified and fierce” marketing activities when they were publicized. However, they may not be as wonderful as “night of the fortress”. This black hole time reminds many players of the metamorphosis of MMORPG online game “Final Fantasy 14” from version 1.0 to 2.0 in the early years. At first, the quality of the game in version 1.0 was too bad, and it was useless except for the quality of the picture. So se gave the follow-up remedial work of the game to a man named Yoshida Zhishu, even in his opinion The game is almost hopeless. From the inside to the outside, it exudes the smell of “problem children”. So Yoshida decided to keep on developing a new game to replace the existing version. For this reason, they have not finished 1.0 yet and designed a very “Final Fantasy” style plan, which is to directly put the 1.0 world into the form of plot performance Destroy it and lead to a new version of the new world.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Night of the fortress was sucked away by a black hole. Players who wanted to play the game were so anxious/c1e8b214b0224172a18e80e418fd2bb7.jpg" alt="Night of the fortress was sucked away by a black hole. Players who wanted to play the game were so anxious"><br>The red moon in Iowa<br>Today’s “Final Fantasy 14” has been updated to version 5.0, and its overall quality and reputation are constantly improving. Now it may have been the MMORPG game with the highest comprehensive quality on the market. Now, looking back at the original version 1.0, it’s just like a disaster in the plot. Although the two have the same pattern, they have totally different interests. Since the official transition of Fortress night to the big escape game, its popularity has remained high overseas. At the end of each season, there will be an extremely gorgeous curtain call performance. This time, it is the same practice, only a little sudden; and the final fantasy 14 is pure It’s a decision they have to make to save the game, and it turns out that the choices they make are worth it, so they are approved by the industry and recognized by the players.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Night of the fortress was sucked away by a black hole. Players who wanted to play the game were so anxious/8a4c360268f743afb889274c74d0b355.jpg" alt="Night of the fortress was sucked away by a black hole. Players who wanted to play the game were so anxious"><br>Final fantasy 14: the reverse flame of shadow<br>    concluding remarks<br>No matter “night of the fortress” or “Final Fantasy 14”, although these marketing models are very eye-catching, they are more sincere than the general advertising and announcement. If they don’t have a passion for their products, maybe no one is willing to use this time-consuming and laborious way. And “Final Fantasy 14” has become the best MMORPG in the industry, and “night of the fortress” has become the most successful work ever by epic, which fully proves this point. They are really doing games with their hearts, and the players have fun, and their money is also solid. There may be many more such works on the market, but thousands of words come together into one sentence: A good plan for a game is really very important.</p>

    <title>Once gone, it&#39;s hard to return. Video games have become the biggest support for the word-of-mouth of digital baby</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>In recent years, the most controversial game, in addition to Hideki Oshima’s “death stranded”, is Gamefreak’s “Baoke dream: Sword / shield”. Because of the era cutting, the great change of game style and gf’s saying and doing a set, many Baoke dream fans are dissatisfied. No matter how the players criticize GF, how they are not optimistic about the new works of this generation, they will buy them. The feelings of the players it carries are far beyond the comparison of other games.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Once gone, it's hard to return. Video games have become the biggest support for the word-of-mouth of digital baby/005bdfb7b1c04280aa523fc15350894f.jpg" alt="Once gone, it&#39;s hard to return. Video games have become the biggest support for the word-of-mouth of digital baby"><br>But on the other side, it started almost at the same time as Baoke dream, and it is also not so lucky for many post-90s’ memories of “digital baby”. In many people’s eyes, the two works are always in a state where you come and I compete with each other. A “infinite” Butterfly can make many people boil with blood when it rings. It’s true, but in the process of follow-up development, “digital baby” has failed to live up to the expectations of fans. From the beginning, the positioning of the two works is totally different. If “baokemeng” chooses the sustainable development of the whole field, and “digital baby” can be said to focus on one way and finally hit the wall.</p>
<h1 id="“digital-monster”"><a href="#“digital-monster”" class="headerlink" title="“digital monster”"></a>“digital monster”</h1><p>It is believed that most people know the name of “digital baby” through the TV animation launched around 2000, and those who know the IP know that the name of “digital baby” came out with a unique style of “electronic pet” when it was first born. In the early years, the electronic pet toy “Tuoma Gezi” produced by Wandai relied on its lovely image after it was put on the market As well as the extremely high interactivity, it has achieved unexpected success. No matter from the perspective of toy modeling or play mode, Touma Gezi is a toy for girls. In view of the great commercial potential of this toy, Wandai also plans to launch an electronic pet for boys, named “digital monster”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Once gone, it's hard to return. Video games have become the biggest support for the word-of-mouth of digital baby/39f5988ecebe475f82515b114e45f2a0.jpg" alt="Once gone, it&#39;s hard to return. Video games have become the biggest support for the word-of-mouth of digital baby"><br>The first generation of digital monster game machine (the picture is a replica of the 20th anniversary)<br>Until now, the marketing methods of promoting toys through TV animation and peripheral products are still very marketable. Even the animation of baokemeng was originally broadcast to promote the game, and “digital monster” is no exception. In order to promote their own electronic toys, the animation “digital baby big adventure” was launched. With excellent production and deeply rooted plot design, animation has gained quite high evaluation in the global field, and until now, where there is a secondary culture, we can see the relevant secondary creation of “digital baby”. The success of animation also directly promoted the sales volume of “digital monsters”. From 1997 to 2001, the sales volume of “digital monsters” reached 20 million sets.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Once gone, it's hard to return. Video games have become the biggest support for the word-of-mouth of digital baby/54946b124e18405da6ec192015897965.jpg" alt="Once gone, it&#39;s hard to return. Video games have become the biggest support for the word-of-mouth of digital baby"><br>Animation troupe of the early generation<br>    positioning<br>Compared with “Baoke dream”, the setting of “digital baby” is undoubtedly more “cool”, and it is more inclined to teenagers in the plot style. In the animation, several selected children build fetters with their own digital beasts in different worlds and fight against the evil digital beasts. When they fight, they can also improve their combat effectiveness through evolution, and the shape of the digital beasts is also more evolved Higher is more handsome. In fact, the toy orientation of “digital monsters” is to encourage players to cultivate their own digital monsters and fight with other players with digital monsters. Most of the human characters in the animation are almost in the same camp. Although they are different from the toy settings, they retain the core element of “fight” somehow.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Once gone, it's hard to return. Video games have become the biggest support for the word-of-mouth of digital baby/d338069ac89d4ce5856ef21190e59726.jpg" alt="Once gone, it&#39;s hard to return. Video games have become the biggest support for the word-of-mouth of digital baby"><br>There are many styles, but the playing methods are basically the same<br>However, people who have seen this work should be able to feel that the protagonist’s partner in “digital baby” is a “monster”, and each monster has the ability to communicate with the human protagonist, which leads to a more normal relationship between humans and monsters, more like humans driving monsters to fight, if not the plot design, it is difficult to feel the cordiality between the two sides; and “Baoke dream” 》Although it was originally called “the pocket monster”, almost all non-human characters were designed according to the image of animals. First of all, they were more friendly to the people in terms of modeling. However, there would be a gap between the two races that could not be directly communicated. The plot was created on the basis of this gap step by step. Usually, human characters need to accommodate the character of Baoke dream rather than Baoke dream Accommodating human beings, this humble setting makes the plot more sympathetic in performance.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Once gone, it's hard to return. Video games have become the biggest support for the word-of-mouth of digital baby/a83d17b10deb4e19885e0e91fbab5506.jpg" alt="Once gone, it&#39;s hard to return. Video games have become the biggest support for the word-of-mouth of digital baby"><br>What we need to know is that Wan Dai is in charge of toy sales, while Dong Ying is in charge of animation production. They are used to “let the design of animation give way to toys” all the time. How to design animation for toys is how to design. Unlike baokemeng, animation follows the game. The biggest drawback of doing so is that the sales volume of products is directly tied with the production quality of animation. Animation If it’s finished, the toy sales will be finished. Therefore, in order to be able to launch more innovative toys one after another, the animation of “digital baby” began to gradually enrich the world view setting, and even did not care about the previous setting of another world view. Although the courage to do so is commendable, the disadvantage lies in that the animation setting is almost an audience group, and it is difficult for old fans to be retained in the new work, that is, it has appeared since the second generation After each generation, there are new fans to join, and each generation has more old fans out of the hole, so that even though the latest “digital baby tri” makes the leading group of the first movie all return, it still makes the fans have a sense of separation.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Once gone, it's hard to return. Video games have become the biggest support for the word-of-mouth of digital baby/c8a8fef2cfb24c94ae981a74807184d6.jpg" alt="Once gone, it&#39;s hard to return. Video games have become the biggest support for the word-of-mouth of digital baby"><br>Digital baby tri<br>    guarantee<br>Like baokemeng, in addition to promoting toys with animation, Wanda has also launched a series of peripheral products, and the game has not fallen, after all, “digital monster” is essentially a game machine. Different from the game console, the game of “digital baby” is made according to the animation settings. After all, the plot and settings of what kind of electronic pet can be. This is an unexpected phenomenon: if you have not seen the animation, you will not be interested in toys and games. You can see that these peripheral products are basically fans oriented, so it is difficult to guarantee the quality. There are dozens of games of “digital baby” launched so far, all of which are personal computers of handhelds and mobile phones. They can also be divided into large and small branches. The types of these games are from RPG to leisure cultivation. These games are almost plain response of qingyishui, and even not many players will pay attention to them.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Once gone, it's hard to return. Video games have become the biggest support for the word-of-mouth of digital baby/a7353c8d02414c99860b3f2c3c4dc4c4.jpg" alt="Once gone, it&#39;s hard to return. Video games have become the biggest support for the word-of-mouth of digital baby"><br>PS platform “digital baby world 3”<br>In 2013, Wandai launched a work “big adventure of digital baby” exclusive to PSP platform, which can be said to be the first successful work in the history of the whole game of digital baby, largely due to the plot design of the whole first animation game process, on the other hand, the quality of the game itself is also remarkable, as a pure round system RPG games are also very good to play, there is no serious fan tendency.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Once gone, it's hard to return. Video games have become the biggest support for the word-of-mouth of digital baby/738fba36318c4baebabca54b3cddc563.jpg" alt="Once gone, it&#39;s hard to return. Video games have become the biggest support for the word-of-mouth of digital baby"><br>Digital baby Adventure<br>Two years later, in charge of the production and distribution of the game, the Wanda Nanmeng palace decided to take “digital baby” out of the competitive sub supply market and turn to the adult market and overseas market, and launched the previous sequel “next 0rder -“ of “digital animal world” and “cyberdetective” of “digital baby language”, adopting a tougher and more delicate game painting style, as well as in the characters The design is more fashionable and handsome, and it seems that no matter what type of digital baby series is made, it is always inferior to RPG games with stronger playability and strategy. Therefore, these two games adopt a more conservative RPG game mode, but the former pays attention to cultivation, while the latter is a more traditional hard core. These two works have a good reputation in the RPG field, but the sales volume may not be very ideal. After all, the old fans have been consumed by the animation of this IP, and these games have become the only support on the reputation of “digital baby”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Once gone, it's hard to return. Video games have become the biggest support for the word-of-mouth of digital baby/2325196b7e0c428a8d51c640ab4740a3.jpg" alt="Once gone, it&#39;s hard to return.

Video games have become the biggest support for the word-of-mouth of digital baby"><br>Digital baby: desperate for survival<br>The timely transformation after experiencing the storm is to keep the bottom line of “digital baby”. In short, the most emotional crowd for this series is the fans of the first animation. Now these people have grown up and are no longer interested in the works of zigongxiang. Later, these better works are oriented to these people, after all, almost Each generation has its own fans. It’s hard for all fans to satisfy whether it’s animation or games. It’s better to give priority to the group with the largest base. Although this can keep pace at present, it is doomed not to go too far. At present, the community environment of “digital baby” is gradually getting better. I hope that “digital baby” can find a new breakthrough in the near future.</p>

    <title>One forward, one backward, second development of square Enix</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/One%20forward,%20one%20backward,%20second%20development%20of%20square%20Enix/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In April this year, Japan’s Toyo Co., Ltd. released the first trailer of CG animated film “the brave fights the Dragon: your story”. This film is authorized and produced by Japanese game manufacturer square Enix (Se for short). It is based on the plot of the most popular fifth generation game work “bride of the sky” and released in Japan on August 2, 2019 。 When the classic and familiar theme song is played in the trailer, the author is very excited. After all, it’s the same product of se. There are several films in the final fantasy series, but none in the brave fight against the Dragon (DQ). Se is known as the “movie factory”. There’s no doubt about its strength in making films, but whether it can tell a good story or not Things are waiting to be seen.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/One forward, one backward, second development of square Enix/12e595b83b4d437789decc598e5cece1.jpg" alt="One forward, one backward, second development of square Enix"><br>It is expected that this theatre version is of high quality in both production and dubbing, and the plot performance is also excellent. However, the ending of the film has stabbed many fans in the heart of the series. Therefore, the movie’s public praise has been polarized and controversial, saying “this is a smear for the brave fight against the dragon”. After a while, the fans’ anger subsided, and they focused on another work of this IP, so that the image of “the brave fight against the dragon” of this IP was righted again.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/One forward, one backward, second development of square Enix/f69496f782cd4b3fbfb3be232dc8ee75.jpg" alt="One forward, one backward, second development of square Enix"></p>
<h1 id="two-major-IPS"><a href="#two-major-IPS" class="headerlink" title="two major IPS"></a>two major IPS</h1><p>As we all know, se has the two most valuable RPG game IPS in Japan, one is the “ultimate fantasy” series known as “the most influential RPG in the world”, and the other is the “brave fight against the dragon” series known as “Japanese national RPG”. By comparing these two titles, we can see that one of these two IPS is for the local market of Japan, and the other is for the local market of Japan Overseas global market. In the early years, square and Enix held one IP respectively. Although they were in the same company after the merger, they never intersected and interfered with each other. Although they were both Japanese RPGs, it was difficult to form any relationship between them due to different themes and styles. In order to make the brand accepted by people all over the world, the final fantasy series has always adopted a kind of artistic style similar to the combination of Japanese style and European and American style. The appearance and modeling of the characters are more inclined to the Japanese style of beautiful painting, while the construction of the scene and the design of the background are more inclined to the European and American style, combining the most distinctive parts between the two sides, forming a kind of artistic style in Europe and America The most eye-catching art style recognized by the game industry.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/One forward, one backward, second development of square Enix/5b5ce0cfa35f47129dd8d05beb51a36f.jpg" alt="One forward, one backward, second development of square Enix"><br>DQ, on the other hand, is quite conservative in comparison. It focuses on the local market of Japan, and a routine can stick out to 11 and always maintain high quality. Although the “brave and the devil” story is conventional in the current perspective, it is as simple and direct as a fairy tale, deeply rooted in the people’s heart, and its influence is not easily shaken by other works. For example, although the famous novel Wukong biography reshapes the story of journey to the West in a dark style, and it is a good work in the plot and literature research, but it can never reach the height of the original, and it is still the original version of journey to the West more influential. Back to DQ, the story setting of the game has always been a fantasy adventure in the different world since the early generation, and the main creator, soundtrack and painter of the game have never changed. Bird Shanming relies on a dragon ball, which is well known in the Japanese, so no one can not fail to recognize his style of painting. The reason why DQ series has always insisted on using the original people and horses for many years is to prevent Japan from using it The local people are unfamiliar with this series, no matter how they look at it, it is always original and very cordial.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/One forward, one backward, second development of square Enix/848c1b436f234f49b63a6d66255d4b52.jpg" alt="One forward, one backward, second development of square Enix"></p>
<h1 id="from-outside-to-inside"><a href="#from-outside-to-inside" class="headerlink" title="from outside to inside"></a>from outside to inside</h1><p>The development of “Final Fantasy” series always pays attention to “high-end”, and the primary goal is to pay attention to the extreme in the picture. The latest series of “Final Fantasy 15” uses the “night light engine” which has been polished for many years. It can even show the effect of CG in the picture expression, and there is no “greasy light and shadow” or “messy scene” in other mainstream engines It’s a refreshing and comfortable feeling. With the improvement of development technology, the game is also constantly innovated. Since the beginning of expectation, there have been several changes around the fight, such as changing to read bar turn system, real-time turn system, command action system and pure action system. The purpose of these changes is to try to keep the old IP with many years of history keep up with the trend of the times, and always have a feeling of “showing muscles”, but in the view of players, these are not the key points of this series. As a Japanese RPG, the most King Story can’t be left behind, although the “Final Fantasy” series has not let people down Yes, but it seems that the wind review of “Final Fantasy” in recent years is not good, largely related to the wave after wave of “coquettish operation” of se.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/One forward, one backward, second development of square Enix/c88f38f9042b48f0864e2a62bfe1c13b.jpg" alt="One forward, one backward, second development of square Enix"><br>One by one, “I don’t know if there’s any high-definition version” of “Final Fantasy” has been linked with krypton gold mobile games. The original version of MMORPG game “Final Fantasy 14” was once called “garbage” (although it’s turned over now). The latest work “Final Fantasy 15” is still a semi-finished product that hasn’t finished the story even two years after its release. It’s simple In SE’s opinion, the name of “Final Fantasy” is inlaid with Phnom Penh. As long as new works are produced, no matter what they are made of, they will be bought and played by others. In recent years, scandals about them have made them aware of their problems. They decided to slow down the improvement of the series of hard technologies and focus on the most fundamental games Design and story telling can be seen from the highest score of MMORPG ever obtained by final fantasy 14 and the traditional retro pixel turn setting adopted by novice players. As for final fantasy 15, it may not be saved.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/One forward, one backward, second development of square Enix/24dcfcd94dbe4d3cb3bc670832ece144.jpg" alt="One forward, one backward, second development of square Enix"></p>
<h1 id="from-inside-to-outside"><a href="#from-inside-to-outside" class="headerlink" title="from inside to outside"></a>from inside to outside</h1><p>As mentioned above, although DQ series has chosen a conservative route, it is also trying to innovate. However, the traditional RPG mode of its orthodox works is absolutely unchanged. This is because they have tried to change the orthodox works into action games, but the players are very dissatisfied with this. A large number of players say that if DQ is changed into action games, then it must be Will not buy, but can only change back. They don’t want to change, but they dare not. The good reputation and stable quality accumulated over the years are the basis for this series to continue to sell well, so they can only make articles on other derivative works, such as the cooperation with Koei to launch the “mowing” game “DQ: Yingxiong” series, the “DQ: Chuangshi little player” series, which combines RPG and sandbox, and so on All of them are trying to expand this IP to other fields, and it seems that the title of “national RPG” is the guarantee of quality. These works are not performing well in the early stage, and if we launch a sequel, we can get back the reputation, which is undoubtedly a virtue.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/One forward, one backward, second development of square Enix/cae74208f8a44ea08182ce290f71d69a.jpg" alt="One forward, one backward, second development of square Enix"><br>The latest work of “DQ” mentioned at the beginning of the article is another new attempt of this IP in a new field: “DQ: walk” is an AR themed mobile game, just like “baokemeng go” in the early years. DQ walk is to let players play a brave man with their mobile phones to explore and fight around Japan. In the game, players are provided with an RPG that can be created by themselves In the world, every plot has its own settings, which can be said to be a perfect combination of traditional RPG and AR outdoor exploration. Soon after the game went online, it ranked first in various markets. The reputation of the players was very popular, which reversed the reputation of the movie. Before that, “DQ” also had a variety of mobile tours abroad, but its performance can only be described by ordinary, and this time it is undoubtedly to make people’s impression of “DQ” mobile tour changed.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/One forward, one backward, second development of square Enix/c8fc6e34800e46ceb955a0540a37567e.jpg" alt="One forward, one backward, second development of square Enix"><br>    concluding remarks<br>It’s ironic that the final fantasy series was isolated from the very beginning, thinking that they were fearless, only to realize their problems after a few times of eating, and decided to lay a good foundation again from scratch, from “high-end” to “conservative”, which undoubtedly felt backward; while the DQ series was consistent for many years On the basis of the bold attempt to derivative works, even AR, a novelty, is quite interested, and has achieved success. Undoubtedly, it is a little step forward, forming a situation of position exchange with “Final Fantasy”, which seems slightly ridiculous. But in any case, this is a good thing for both of them. Neither of them is a work that can seal the gods. Although they are not young, they still have a way to go. I hope that after this “slow down of rhythm”, both of them can bring more high-quality works to the players.</p>

    <title>Once the biggest manufacturer of mobile games, looking back on the changes of mobile games from Gameloft</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/Once%20the%20biggest%20manufacturer%20of%20mobile%20games,%20looking%20back%20on%20the%20changes%20of%20mobile%20games%20from%20Gameloft/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to mobile games, the popular ones are either competitive games or leisure games. The homogenization of mobile game market is very serious, which is basically “what’s hot and what to do”. The stereotyped style makes people feel tired. Looking back at the time when the mobile game market was not so mixed, we can find many classic and excellent mobile game works, among which the large-scale single player games accounted for the majority, and to mention the most popular one in the mobile game market at that time, Gameloft (Zhile), a game developer under the natural illegal state Ubisoft, belongs to.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Once the biggest manufacturer of mobile games, looking back on the changes of mobile games from Gameloft/a21588cecd99467a8597e0fe63bd3808.jpg" alt="Once the biggest manufacturer of mobile games, looking back on the changes of mobile games from Gameloft"><br>Although in the field of mobile games, the backup of Zhile is not large, but in terms of seniority and the level of game production, it deserves to be the largest factory. In the era when mobile games are still produced in Java, the Games launched by Zhile have been “3A production” in the field of mobile games. If we look back on the development of Gameloft, we will also look back on the development of the whole field of mobile games.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Once the biggest manufacturer of mobile games, looking back on the changes of mobile games from Gameloft/5667f4916ef240ba889874d7307c2a06.jpg" alt="Once the biggest manufacturer of mobile games, looking back on the changes of mobile games from Gameloft"></p>
<p>#Born with great ideals<br>Founded in France in 1999, Zhile is a subsidiary of Ubisoft, a leading manufacturer, focusing on software development of various non mainstream platforms. Zhile has been directly listed since its establishment, which is very confident. During that time, even the parent company Ubisoft was wondering how to carry forward its own game. After all, the original IP in Ubisoft’s hands was not so much, mainly the development of third-party games. Zhile has spent four years accumulating resources for itself and is planning to play a big game of chess. At that time, although the mobile phone has also been upgraded from black-and-white screen to full color screen, few people would want to play games with mobile phones. After all, there are better platforms such as mainframe and PC.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Once the biggest manufacturer of mobile games, looking back on the changes of mobile games from Gameloft/6e2d9dc1e69247bf8f792ee51254ba69.jpg" alt="Once the biggest manufacturer of mobile games, looking back on the changes of mobile games from Gameloft"><br>Those who really liked playing games could play snake for an afternoon<br>Zhile became the first person who dared to eat crabs. He developed several mobile games with the IP borrowed from Ubisoft, such as cell division and Prince of Persia. Although the function of mobile phones is limited, Zhile did its best to make mobile games in the most appropriate form. In addition to the number of frames, these Games were as good as Nintendo at that time The production of GBA hand-held game one higher. In addition to Zhile, no one seems to notice that the mobile phone is an undeveloped territory, so Zhile’s game naturally left a deep impression on many players, but at that time, the players didn’t have a high sense of brand, and only a few can remember who the developer of the game was.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Once the biggest manufacturer of mobile games, looking back on the changes of mobile games from Gameloft/0fd67cd43cbc46d5a03270f4b2e9ad64.jpg" alt="Once the biggest manufacturer of mobile games, looking back on the changes of mobile games from Gameloft"><br>Cell division in Java<br>Not many years later, there is a wave of revolution in the palm industry. Sony’s PSP and Nintendo’s NDS have launched their own sub era palm, and the picture of the palm game has entered the 3D era. At the same time, the field of mobile phones has also begun to update. Since 2002, Nokia, a well-known manufacturer, has entered the market with a new concept of smart phones. The performance of mobile phones has been greatly improved. When people in the game circle are still fighting for the palm of their home, the players of mobile games are also growing slowly. With the development of information technology, we will know who’s playing the game well.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Once the biggest manufacturer of mobile games, looking back on the changes of mobile games from Gameloft/9445ec25a2574f17800ea09a2211545f.jpg" alt="Once the biggest manufacturer of mobile games, looking back on the changes of mobile games from Gameloft"><br>Nokia’s first smartphone, 7650, uses the first Symbian system<br>At that time, Zhile began to launch its own original IP, including “real football”, “billiards at midnight” and “wild racing” (then called urban racing), which is still popular. At that time, every game seemed to have a very good production. People can’t imagine what it would be like to castrate the end game masterpieces when they moved to the mobile platform. Zhile proved to people that although the picture is not as good as the end game, they are also unambiguous in the quality of the game. The saying “Gameloft products must be high-quality products” spread from then on.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Once the biggest manufacturer of mobile games, looking back on the changes of mobile games from Gameloft/70dfdab22a2a47f8b525e43ea3c61620.jpg" alt="Once the biggest manufacturer of mobile games, looking back on the changes of mobile games from Gameloft"><br>“Real football” by sparrow</p>
<h1 id="“copy”-a-day"><a href="#“copy”-a-day" class="headerlink" title="“copy” a day"></a>“copy” a day</h1><p>Time goes on again. The production technology of mobile phone is enough to make it run 3D games with poor picture quality. With money, Gameloft can’t let go of this opportunity. It starts to make games with the third-party IP on the bottom intelligent machine, and develops its own original IP on the middle and high-end machines, so there are many names that are very familiar in the current period, such as Modern war, lone vehicle God, n.o.v.a and so on. But many people can see that Zhile, many so-called original works, can find corresponding works on the end-user platform, such as modern war corresponding to call of duty, lone vehicle God corresponding to GTA, n.o.v.a corresponding to halo and so on. Observe one by one It seems that except for some casual chess and card games, almost every one of them is not completely original.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Once the biggest manufacturer of mobile games, looking back on the changes of mobile games from Gameloft/53d03bce11074b7c984dc91617c0c1c8.jpg" alt="Once the biggest manufacturer of mobile games, looking back on the changes of mobile games from Gameloft"><br>Many of the high-quality people in the modern war series regard call of duty as the same series<br>Many fans of Zhile say that Zhile’s games can’t be regarded as plagiarism. After all, there are so many types of games, so we can’t only allow end-to-end games but not hand games. Moreover, the market in which mobile games compete with console games doesn’t affect each other. There is no direct competition between the two. In the end, mobile games can’t be compared with console games, no matter from the production level With the technical ability to swim far less than the end of the advantages of swimming. This scene is very similar to the recent event that a domestic game copied a Japanese game. These words were quite convincing a few years ago. After all, as a matter of fact, the quality of Zhile’s game was absolutely the leading position in the whole mobile game field at that time, and as the host market generally used buyout system to charge, krypton’s mobile game was better than many crude and powerful ones Many hearts.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Once the biggest manufacturer of mobile games, looking back on the changes of mobile games from Gameloft/5cac24824d2f4667abf7e15e9694d34d.jpg" alt="Once the biggest manufacturer of mobile games, looking back on the changes of mobile games from Gameloft"><br>It’s not so much like GTA as it’s a little bit of the bad taste of the underworld saints</p>
<p>#Both new and experienced<br>Zhile, who has always been taking the quality route, is not stingy in the development of game resources. Even if it is to promote a certain film and television works and develop derivative games, it will invest a lot of resources to create high-quality products. When smart phones began to explode in the society, for some reason, Zhile’s buyout game sales were not ideal, and many of its own free plus buy games could not generate much revenue. Why did it happen? After all, where does Zhile know how to reasonably operate a F2P game after a lifetime of single machine work? Their internal purchase content settings are very bad, and they can basically reach the level that they can’t play without spending money. They are criticized by the players. Zhile’s former position is still stable, even though its company’s reputation has gone from year to year.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Once the biggest manufacturer of mobile games, looking back on the changes of mobile games from Gameloft/e3b7d97b01774f76a93252912dfb17eb.jpg" alt="Once the biggest manufacturer of mobile games, looking back on the changes of mobile games from Gameloft"><br>The Iron Man 3 movie game with a huge scale but only Parkour game<br>Officially, because of the lack of market understanding and cognition, and the change of the whole society, they didn’t realize that the players holding the mobile game all day long were not the pure game enthusiasts in those days, but more leisure players who idled around and played with their mobile phones casually. They played the game purely to pass the time, rather than enjoy the fun of the game as before The family itself is resistant to buy-out game. If krypton gold can get a good game experience properly, it can also be accepted. If krypton gold can’t play any more, they may go back to find the “modified version”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Once the biggest manufacturer of mobile games, looking back on the changes of mobile games from Gameloft/91683b3acfcc457db5b4a70abba504df.jpg" alt="Once the biggest manufacturer of mobile games, looking back on the changes of mobile games from Gameloft"><br>Six engine left wheel with krypton gold UI on the table<br>    concluding remarks<br>As the company’s philosophy has not been changed, it continues to maintain a high expenditure and low income, and it is indisputable to go to a state of saving losses, because the stock price is too low, it was finally acquired by Vivendi. Everyone knows that Vivendi is a famous “industry pooper”. After the acquisition, all board members and core members, including the CEO, chose to leave. Since then, Zhile has no more works that can be remembered.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Once the biggest manufacturer of mobile games, looking back on the changes of mobile games from Gameloft/6454e32a2cf44a34a31273e4c4875f9a.jpg" alt="Once the biggest manufacturer of mobile games, looking back on the changes of mobile games from Gameloft"><br>“Wild car racing 9: Legend” with amazing pictures<br>Until last year’s “wild racing 9”, which seems to indicate that this is the only work that can still be sold now. After all, after eight generations of experience, the series has gone on its own way from imitating others. Fortunately, the production quality of the game is still excellent, and even the best game in 2018. It is obvious that the brilliance of Zhile is not as good as it used to be, but now it is only they who know whether Zhile lives or dies.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>At the end of May, Netease released the mobile game live screen of Eve Star Wars Eve: the river of stars without ashes at the Interactive Entertainment Conference, which aroused the discussion among players and expressed the experience of operation like Eve and its tedious mobile game.<br>Since the agent work of Eve ol in China was transferred from century Tiancheng to Netease, there has been no big move. This time, we transplanted this heavyweight IP to mobile platform. Although in the eyes of our players, it may have ruined this IP, polluted the game environment and so on, on the good side, logging in to the mobile terminal will undoubtedly increase the exposure rate of the game, otherwise, we only rely on it It’s really hard for the existing players to keep the game running.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Online games despised the company at the top of the chain, and had a bigger dream/01c363106507446ebd2670f6c5bd00a8.jpg" alt="Online games despised the company at the top of the chain, and had a bigger dream"><br>When it comes to Eve, many players seem to recognize it as the existence of “you can’t play without a doctor’s degree”, “you have to make formulas to start a shot”, “online games despise the top of the chain”. He is a synonym for the space sandbox game, but due to the too complex content and its poor operation, ordinary players can turn off the game in four or five minutes with a dull face, and those who can stick to it are hard core players who really like hard science fiction and study hard.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Online games despised the company at the top of the chain, and had a bigger dream/5db6db90e65e48cc9161c7b5344d3d75.jpg" alt="Online games despised the company at the top of the chain, and had a bigger dream"><br>However, not everyone is willing to be a hard core player. Although Eve has been running for so many years, it can still maintain a stable number of players from a commercial point of view, which is not a small success, but even the most fun games have a life cycle. Eve, a player with a small number of players, is no exception. Therefore, how can we continue to make our own king Brand IP long-term vitality is also the biggest issue developers should consider.</p>
<h1 id="CCP’s-“wild-hope”"><a href="#CCP’s-“wild-hope”" class="headerlink" title="CCP’s “wild hope”"></a>CCP’s “wild hope”</h1><p>The universe is always a very mysterious topic for people. It is just because the mystery of the universe can arouse people’s infinite imagination, and the relevant creators can also give full play to their genius ideas, so we are lucky to have access to a variety of cross domain and diversified related subject products.<br>Speaking of making the most famous sci-fi game in the field of video games, Chris Roberts, known as the “godfather of space games”, has developed “interstellar citizen”. “Star citizen” has a well-designed space colonial planet and space station for players to explore, and there are very deep spacecraft operation and space tangle, players can also go out of the spacecraft to control your pilot’s random action, use guns to fight with other enemies, although the game has not been fully developed so far, but with the existing content is enough to achieve many Player’s space dream.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Online games despised the company at the top of the chain, and had a bigger dream/73ee5ad822dd410b81cee6ff0efe0f23.jpg" alt="Online games despised the company at the top of the chain, and had a bigger dream"><br>Why is interstellar citizen mentioned here? Because no matter in who’s eyes, this kind of game is the ultimate form of space game, which is the most desired space game for players. Although the content of Eve is rich enough, it is only a space star wars game after all, and does not contain a combat system that can make people feel refreshed. For this reason, the Icelandic CCP, the developer of the game, has such a grand plan:   they want to make an FPS game, a VR air war simulation game, and these games can be linked and synchronized with Eve to achieve three A comprehensive war in which different dimensions can influence each other.<br>Imagine “Eve” players controlling the fleet in the air, Gunners controlling the turrets on the warship to shoot out dense light and shells, small ships swimming through the warships, the explosion debris fell on the ground near the two soldiers in short combat, can participate in such a huge science fiction battlefield in person enough to make many science fiction fans salivate.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Online games despised the company at the top of the chain, and had a bigger dream/e9c507b56fdb49f1aaa5d7ce259ffc33.jpg" alt="Online games despised the company at the top of the chain, and had a bigger dream"></p>
<h1 id="“Trinity-”"><a href="#“Trinity-”" class="headerlink" title="“Trinity?”"></a>“Trinity?”</h1><p>Since we have to do so, the first project launched by CCP is FPS game, named Eve: dust 514, which is a shooting game integrating FPS, RTs and RPG, and the time of occurrence in Eve will directly affect dust 514. These settings sound very attractive, and the CCP did what they boasted at the beginning, but who can guarantee the quality of such an avant-garde game? The game landed on the PS3 platform at the end of last era and was released in the form of free.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Online games despised the company at the top of the chain, and had a bigger dream/42276a05bce14b39806cb325d3e24dab.jpg" alt="Online games despised the company at the top of the chain, and had a bigger dream"><br>Why do not manufacturers dare to play such a game except CCP? Because the design is too avant-garde, there are problems in all aspects of the design of the game: the picture of the game is not excellent, but mediocre; the hand feel of weapons and driving is very bad, obviously lack of experience in the development of relevant content; since the game is released free, it means that krypton gold is needed inside the game, but it can be accepted if the price is reasonable, but krypton gold is not good Fun that’s a fatal problem.<br>The immaturity of the game system and the distracted charging mechanism make the game perform badly in the experience of playing. Many media have given failing scores, and the update speed is slow in the later stage of the game, resulting in the suspension of service within less than four years of operation.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Online games despised the company at the top of the chain, and had a bigger dream/7d37a97a3c574e4084c284bd52a19f2f.jpg" alt="Online games despised the company at the top of the chain, and had a bigger dream"><br>The first attempt ended with the death of “dust 514”, but the CCP did not feel depressed about it, but turned its attention to the next project. Even before VR devices began to be popularized on the market, CCP announced its next game, Eve: Valkyrie, which will be a VR air war simulation game, in which players can fly small space fighters to participate in the grand space war experience real air dog fight.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Online games despised the company at the top of the chain, and had a bigger dream/c7284455c8074ad2abc46925b5e310de.jpg" alt="Online games despised the company at the top of the chain, and had a bigger dream"><br>CCP has come to the front of the industry again this time. They have expected that the next period of time will be the explosive growth stage of VR technology, and even lead the new wave of entertainment technology. With more and more manufacturers releasing information about VR equipment, many capitalists have also taken a fancy to this fertile land to be developed, and CCP has also got a fund sponsorship for the development of “Valkyrie”. Now that there is money, we have to polish the game. 2016 is called the first year of VR. There is a tripartite confrontation in the market, led by oculus, PSVR and HTC vive. At this time, our “Valkyrie” is still being polished, and it will not be released until the second half of 2017.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Online games despised the company at the top of the chain, and had a bigger dream/3764631805d14b849128208deceac6e0.jpg" alt="Online games despised the company at the top of the chain, and had a bigger dream"><br>The game only landed on the PC platform. As one of the first batch of VR games published, the image quality of Valkyrie is undoubtedly the best. Compared with the consistent rough works on the market, Valkyrie is undoubtedly the best work that meets the requirements of the players.<br>Of course, to experience the most powerful VR game is bound to pay a little price. As a PC-side VR game, its price has reached a staggering 400 RMB, and with all DLC content, it can reach a sky high price of nearly 2000 RMB. The price of its own VR device is already high, and it also needs a computer with excellent configuration, and it also costs 2000 yuan to buy a game, who is it to change I don’t think so. As a result, although the quality of the game is excellent, but the sales volume is very low, CCP has to reduce the price of the game, but who can think that the popularity of VR soon passed away.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Online games despised the company at the top of the chain, and had a bigger dream/cbedb456f9014439bfe9bd256e4f70e6.jpg" alt="Online games despised the company at the top of the chain, and had a bigger dream"><br>    concluding remarks<br>Since then, CCP has also launched some simple VR games for mobile phones, but the popularity of VR has gone, and it can no longer attract the attention of players. It’s good to have great ambition, but it’s too long-term and too big for CCP to stand firm. It’s understandable that CCP wants to maintain Eve’s popularity. But we can be sure that CCP hasn’t been satisfied with the game’s interest. What they have been doing is a hard core game for a small number of people, so they can’t blame others for the small number of players.<br>The author has always been interested in the game Eve, but has no chance to contact it due to work reasons. This login to the mobile platform is undoubtedly a timid attempt. I hope that the mobile version can make corresponding adjustments to the mobile platform, otherwise it will not avoid the cold fate.</p>

    <title>Only for the continuation of the dream, what made Sega quit the mainframe field</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/Only%20for%20the%20continuation%20of%20the%20dream,%20what%20made%20Sega%20quit%20the%20mainframe%20field/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In the late 1980s, Nintendo reopened the game market impacted by yadali with its own FC game console, giving people a new understanding of video games. Although Nintendo’s game consoles have a great impact on overseas players, and the relationship with us is not very big, but there are also some people who have been lucky to have access to this popular element from overseas since that time, and have a concept of video games for the first time. And Nintendo’s rising sun naturally makes many other companies see business opportunities from it, and also want to take a share of profits from it. Among them, the only one who has this ability is Sega, who is rising sun in the field of arcade.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Only for the continuation of the dream, what made Sega quit the mainframe field/3529b5593b8b4306823a895c85476928.jpg" alt="Only for the continuation of the dream, what made Sega quit the mainframe field"><br>During the period from the late 1980s to the early 1990s, Sega seized nearly half of the game market from Nintendo by relying on MD console. There was a situation in which Nintendo dominated the eastern hemisphere market and Sega dominated the Western Hemisphere market for a while. However, such a company has no mainframe industry and no longer wants to compete with other manufacturers. It focuses on the development and distribution of software and becomes extremely humble and low-key. Some people say that the mainframe industry has brought down Sega, while others say that the high cost and low income of game “Shamu” make Sega unable to make ends meet. In fact, these persuasions are not complete What I have to say may be because I am short-sighted and a little unlucky.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Only for the continuation of the dream, what made Sega quit the mainframe field/f8a5779344604d4f9ae20c68bcbef954.jpg" alt="Only for the continuation of the dream, what made Sega quit the mainframe field"><br>    stunt<br>During the period when MD hosts occupied half of the country, the game industry was not peaceful. Several game companies seemed to be competing in any kind of arms race, generally competing with each other in science and technology, and all kinds of novel products emerged in an endless stream. Home games ushered in an explosive growth period, so the key is to improve the performance of the host and the performance of the game screen as soon as possible. Sega successively launched two peripherals for MD host, one named Mega CD, and the other named Sega 32x. These two peripherals can be installed on MD host to improve performance. The former can be regarded as an additional CD-ROM drive processing unit, while the latter is an additional new processor module. Although these two peripherals can improve the function of MD, they have a high price. Such a set of prices is no less than buying a new machine, and the new carrier games for these two peripherals are not very attractive, so the achievements of these two peripherals can be said to be quite bleak.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Only for the continuation of the dream, what made Sega quit the mainframe field/a95693e8dcd84cb492d4d8022859d537.jpg" alt="Only for the continuation of the dream, what made Sega quit the mainframe field"><br>Three in one Sega MD<br>Strictly speaking, all the money MD has made in the western hemisphere has been wasted on these useless and expensive peripherals, which makes Sega lose his life. Nintendo doesn’t have the brainless output of Sega. They think that money should be used on the edge of the blade, rather than the gimmicks. The performance of the game machine is the second, and the key is that the game itself is not fun. Nintendo’s new generation of game machine SFC soon had the momentum to catch up with Sega, and Sega also decided to fight hard, only in 32x after-sales soon launched a new generation of host Sega Saturn (also known as SS). Sega Saturn has the ability to hang SFC, and the quality of the game is very excellent. For example, the fighting game “VR warrior” and the racing game “sleepwalking America” which are very popular on the arcade have transplanted versions on the Saturn mainframe. Although the picture is slightly inferior to the arcade, they also have the game experience no less than the mainframe.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Only for the continuation of the dream, what made Sega quit the mainframe field/10896b53f27d487aa9c868058a869629.jpg" alt="Only for the continuation of the dream, what made Sega quit the mainframe field"><br>Sega Saturn host</p>
<h1 id="“299”"><a href="#“299”" class="headerlink" title="“299”"></a>“299”</h1><p>When Sega Saturn is stabilizing its own market, Sony has inadvertently joined in the battle. In the early years, the partnership with Nintendo broke down, so Sony immediately decided to launch PS console. Although it was unable to compete with Sega due to the lack of game lineup, with the spread of the reputation of PS console, the price and performance performance are better than Sega, and the game lineup is competing Gradually enriched, Sony began to work hard to catch up, and soon surpassed Sega. In fact, the hardware performance of PS host is not much better than that of Saturn, but Saturn’s one-dimensional stacking performance leads to the complexity of the host’s architecture, and the difficulty of game development will increase along with the branch line, resulting in the failure of Saturn’s game works to give full play to the full performance of the host. By contrast, most of the first-party games on PS side are all in-depth development of PS hosts, so it seems only a matter of time before Saturn is overtaken by PS.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Only for the continuation of the dream, what made Sega quit the mainframe field/1757167c20c443ce8c74f0747a27b953.jpg" alt="Only for the continuation of the dream, what made Sega quit the mainframe field"><br>Sega VR Warrior 2<br>However, these things are still in the period when PS and Saturn have not entered the European and American market. As the largest host player group in the world, the weight of the European and American market should not be underestimated. Nintendo has not yet launched a new host plan, that is to say, whoever can get the fat meat first will win this round. At the first E3 game show in 1995, Sega announced that the North American version of Saturn’s mainframe was priced at $399, while the Sony PS on the other side was $299, which was a full difference of $100. At that time, you all knew that more than $100 was significant. It was obvious that Sony had lost nothing. After a while, Nintendo also rushed to catch up. Although it came a little later, it brought N64 host and many well received game works to keep up with the trend of the new era, such as legend of Zelda: the flute of time, Nintendo star chaos and other masterpieces were born in this period, leaving only Shijia on the other side to be angry.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Only for the continuation of the dream, what made Sega quit the mainframe field/84a31466b8c4484cb626f710426712ae.jpg" alt="Only for the continuation of the dream, what made Sega quit the mainframe field"><br>Legend of Zelda: flute of time</p>
<h1 id="Dreamcast"><a href="#Dreamcast" class="headerlink" title="Dreamcast"></a>Dreamcast</h1><p>The failure of Saturn made Sega lose a lot of economy, and after continuous eating and shrinking, Sega realized that it should not have the enthusiasm of others. It is necessary to consider the positioning of the host from many aspects, and take a long-term view. But their hosts have always been based on high performance as the selling point, so simply do it thoroughly this time, and directly adopt a better open source The framework makes the development of the game not so difficult as before, and uses new hardware technology to make the host screen rise to the level of another generation, and the host code named “goblin Dao” is called Dreamcast. The game lineup on the DC host can be described as “luxury”. The first party of their own arcade masterpieces are all logged in, and they have the image quality of the arcade without losing. There is also the open world action game “Shamu”, which is personally operated by Suzuki Yu, the arcade God. With these bonuses, how can we see that DC won’t get too bad results.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Only for the continuation of the dream, what made Sega quit the mainframe field/35c8edd2e18a4b9ea09c8f6451441645.jpg" alt="Only for the continuation of the dream, what made Sega quit the mainframe field"><br>Sega Dreamcast<br>In fact, few people will say that the DC host is not good, let alone the game of DC. But in front of Sony’s PS2, there is no big reason for anyone to choose DC. In fact, players have high expectations for DC, but due to various reasons, the output of the host is insufficient, resulting in a situation of short supply. The game is excellent, but it is useless to sell the machine. And Sony just took advantage of the low DC shipments. PS2 is not only several times better than DC in performance, but also has a number of kingly IP products launched. Combined with Sony’s high popularity before, players think DC may be just another transitional product of Sega, and it will come out new soon. Unexpectedly, under the aggressive attitude of PS2, DC has begun to appear weak. If it is not in Europe and the United States that it often advertises, it will not be sustainable.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Only for the continuation of the dream, what made Sega quit the mainframe field/ac0d826f09e649b29bf302015be93ab5.jpg" alt="Only for the continuation of the dream, what made Sega quit the mainframe field"><br>Death or life 2, one of DC’s signature fighting games<br>End of<br>DC’s performance is not ideal again, which once led Sega to the brink of collapse. Finally, in order to maintain the company’s livelihood, Sega decided to reduce its staff and scale, and no longer participate in the competition in the host market, but focus on software development, and become a pure game development company other than the arcade. Nintendo, a former rival, has also become the first choice for Sega to join after leaving the host competition. It has successively moved many of her works to Ren’s game consoles, which is somewhat funny to outsiders, but it is also what Sega has to do to make a living.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Only for the continuation of the dream, what made Sega quit the mainframe field/ca3e8ea16bb94968aa22264c66413f26.jpg" alt="Only for the continuation of the dream, what made Sega quit the mainframe field"><br>Now, Sega’s house watching work like a dragon<br>Today’s Sega is not much more active than before, relying on the series like dragon, all-out war and football manager to obtain stable benefits. Maybe for Sega, she has seen through the fight in this industry. She has suffered deeply until how cruel this industry is. They don’t have any extravagant demands anymore. They just hope that the company can continue to operate steadily. After all, if the company is gone, what’s the ideal and success?</p>

    <title>Paris Commune in the game industry, anecdotes behind the development of independent game dead cell</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>I have a friend who has a headache recently: the connection between his game handle and the computer market will report an error disconnection, which leads to his inability to play the game well, so he has the idea of buying another game on the host, at least the host will not have the situation of the disconnection of the handle. I’m curious about this. What game must be played with a handle and has such a big attraction? This friend told me: “it’s not a masterpiece, it’s just an independent game, the price is not expensive, it’s called” dead cell “<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Paris Commune in the game industry, anecdotes behind the development of independent game dead cell/4cfbc6fa253e4540a30b23836add84de.jpg" alt="Paris Commune in the game industry, anecdotes behind the development of independent game dead cell"><br>This is not the first time I heard the name, but it is the first time I heard the game can make people stunned. After a period of contact and understanding, the author found that not only the dead cell itself is very interesting, but also the developers behind it have a very interesting story.</p>
<p>#”Paris Commune” in the game world<br>Dead cells is a 2D horizontal version of the galaxy like monster city rougelite game developed by motion twin, an independent French game developer. Since the launch of steam in May 2017, it has started the preemptive experience stage. Although it sounds like an unknown game developer, motion twin is actually more qualified than most game companies. Founded in 2001, the company is located in Bordeaux, France, one of the world’s top ten famous wine towns, with a history of 18 years. Over the years, the company has never made an end game. In the first 16 years, it almost only made web games. Although the income is not very high, it is enough to feed the company’s employees. However, with the passage of time, page games have seen a sharp decline in the global market. Mobile games have robbed a large number of users, but in order to make profits, the company has to change.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Paris Commune in the game industry, anecdotes behind the development of independent game dead cell/b3ac28183bf443058bc83a7a62d33870.jpg" alt="Paris Commune in the game industry, anecdotes behind the development of independent game dead cell"><br>The home page of motion twin’s official website is their work concept<br>The working style of the company is quite special. This is a company without a boss. 11 people share the company and the management power of the company. No matter you are a new employee or an old employee, everyone has the same salary, position and voice power. In the past 20 years, this business model has always been the same. The money earned is shared by all. Any decision or even layoff of the company needs to be discussed by all. It’s just like the anarchist Paris Commune in the 19th century. Then someone may ask: since everyone makes the same money, how to distinguish between doing more and doing less? In the view of motion twin, they are a team. Naturally, developing games is not just a matter of one person. It is with such a mindset that almost all employees will not be slack.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Paris Commune in the game industry, anecdotes behind the development of independent game dead cell/569b1e2b7ebd42a387d42c7b1bae005f.jpg" alt="Paris Commune in the game industry, anecdotes behind the development of independent game dead cell"><br>Motion twin’s game works<br>A senior designer of the company once said that: the adoption of such a system by the company is undoubtedly a challenge to the game development industry, but also a challenge to exploitation and old corporate structure. However, they have to transform their business due to the recession of their business. Since the mobile game platform has robbed our users of the past, we will use the mobile game again. Motion twin’s behavior is undoubtedly to want to take a share in this emerging market. However, they are not a full-time mobile game company. Although they have produced many works, they can’t earn as much as page games. The company’s performance has always been in a declining state. As expected, employees have reached an agreement on the situation of the company: if we are going to close down, we must do something we want to do before we close down. Besides, although our income is not high, it is still stable. Why not try to make a different attempt with this money?<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Paris Commune in the game industry, anecdotes behind the development of independent game dead cell/6ac5507eb9394520b23e9d42805ba907.jpg" alt="Paris Commune in the game industry, anecdotes behind the development of independent game dead cell"><br>Most of the games are well made, but their playing methods are rather weird</p>
<p>#Tower defense becomes “Galaxy demon city”<br>According to company officials, “dead cell” was originally a tower defense game called “hordes zreo”, including two kinds of playing methods: construction management and platform action. Steve phelby, the company’s director and marketing manager, went to steam to “explore the enemy” when everyone else was working on the game development, and studied their competitors and the best of the same kind of works, hoping to find out something beneficial to their own game development. He left the company for a week, but when he returned to the company again, he found that the development team had cut off all the tower defense elements and replaced them with a horizontal action game like galactic demon city, which surprised Steve for a while. Besides surprise, he was also surprised: “are you sure you are not doing me?”<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Paris Commune in the game industry, anecdotes behind the development of independent game dead cell/2ab64a3a90a945b08f9c0d6e40ead85c.jpg" alt="Paris Commune in the game industry, anecdotes behind the development of independent game dead cell"><br>“Dead cell” game screen<br>According to the staff in charge of the company’s development work, they really want to make a tower defense game, but they don’t know why they have made a tower defense game that is not fun. The final product after the concept is finalized is far from what they think. This tower defense game is almost the same as a kind of strategic management mobile game on the market. It’s just different from other games on the market in terms of art style. Besides this position, this game has no more attractive highlights. But the most terrible thing is that the employees of the company didn’t realize this at the beginning. When a friend came to visit the company, they gave some very realistic suggestions in the face of the game, which woke them up. The friend said that the prototype design of the game seems to be added to the game later, but it looks more interesting than tower defense. Why don’t you play around this prototype?<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Paris Commune in the game industry, anecdotes behind the development of independent game dead cell/3a9df15c4e724ea88a1ce37ccaca1e43.jpg" alt="Paris Commune in the game industry, anecdotes behind the development of independent game dead cell"><br>Various and refreshing fighting methods<br>The so-called dreamers realized that this is a very suitable theme for being a single person rather than a multi person, so they began to constantly delete the content, remove all the things related to “Tower Defense” and “multi person”, and decided to change the game into a pure horizontal action game. As for the playing method, they hope to adopt the most popular “category” After all, this type is very mature, but how to use this mode of game in the market is not much. Steve, the marketing manager, did nothing this week, but he had to re evaluate the positioning of the game. By studying the predecessors who have been successful in this unique type to determine the core content and key areas, we finally come to the following answer:   the key points of galactic demon city games are fighting, moving, and props balance.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Paris Commune in the game industry, anecdotes behind the development of independent game dead cell/b49bd3ccc7b345428acee875522cee20.jpg" alt="Paris Commune in the game industry, anecdotes behind the development of independent game dead cell"><br>The enemy is full of details</p>
<h1 id="end"><a href="#end" class="headerlink" title="end"></a>end</h1><p>In the end, the product they came up with is the “dead cell” we see today. In terms of playing methods, there are not only the styles of “demon city” and “Galaxy warrior”, but also the depth and difficulty similar to the “soul” series. The fighting and hitting sense of the game is very tension, weapons and props cooperate in a variety of ways, and the moving way of the characters is also aimed at the operation habits of the players A special compensation design has been made; the characters use the permanent death mechanism, and the game map design uses rougelite to generate randomly. Every resurrection will have a new game experience. Although the game has adopted a very excellent but long lost game mode, it is not difficult to see that this pattern is still very popular. At the beginning, the game was launched in the EA stage with the idea of testing the water. As a result, it sold 750 thousand copies in a week. The studio initially predicted that if the twenty thousand sets sold in the first three months could keep the studio alive, it would be possible for the studio to survive. Opportunity to develop new games. At first, they expressed their confidence in selling 12000 sets a month. As a result, they achieved this goal in just one day. They not only made money back, but also made a lot of money.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Paris Commune in the game industry, anecdotes behind the development of independent game dead cell/20030f67f6244289a983ac4f7ac64641.jpg" alt="Paris Commune in the game industry, anecdotes behind the development of independent game dead cell"><br>Steam’s general comments are highly praised<br>Up to now, “dead cell” has launched various host versions one after another, and will also launch mobile versions in the future. The sales volume of the game broke through the million level early and is still rising, and has almost won one-sided praise. In view of the great success of “dead cell”, motion twin, the developer, did not plan to launch a sequel or expand its team. After all, they still want to keep the “little Paris Commune” because it is impossible to expand its scale. As for the new work, the company said that even if it had “dead cell 2”, it would be quite different from this one Type of game.</p>

    <title>People sell the sequels as DLC. Why do you dare to fight against Blizzard</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/People%20sell%20the%20sequels%20as%20DLC.%20Why%20do%20you%20dare%20to%20fight%20against%20Blizzard/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>At the beginning of November, Blizzard held the carnival, which caused a lot of waves. First, Diablo officially announced the existence of the sequel Diablo 4, and then the watch pioneer was about to launch two generations of works. The former “Diablo 4” players have begged for the demand and finally expected the results, while the latter “watch 2” is a little ambiguous. As the youngest independent IP of Blizzard, watch pioneer plans to launch a new work only after three years, which is really confusing.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/People sell the sequels as DLC. Why do you dare to fight against Blizzard/7a4424e8082a49698d19c4757420c638.jpg" alt="People sell the sequels as DLC. Why do you dare to fight against Blizzard"><br>J. Allen black, President of Blizzard, once said that almost every online game’s launch of sequels means that it has been a failure before, while “watch pioneer” has a relatively stable enthusiasm in the overseas market, although it is somewhat acclimatized in the Chinese market, and this launch of sequels is undoubtedly its own proof of failure. Although Blizzard has released watch 2, it seems that the difference between this sequel and the previous one is not very big according to the current information. It is not so much a sequel as a new major version update.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/People sell the sequels as DLC. Why do you dare to fight against Blizzard/09e1476dd15146cf9b712babd373bc18.jpg" alt="People sell the sequels as DLC. Why do you dare to fight against Blizzard"><br>    suspense<br>First of all, let’s see what information watch2 has released: compared with the previous game with multi player confrontation as the core, it seems that watch2 will focus slightly on the multi player cooperation PVE mode that players have been looking forward to bringing. Up to now, we haven’t clearly explained what kind of story is told in the world view of this game. It seems that all the story processes will be explained in the cooperation mode of watch 2. Blizzard said that “watch 2” will use a new upgraded engine, because the previous engine is designed to focus on the previous work of multiplayer combat, only to create a better multiplayer combat experience, and because half of the content of the new work will be cooperation mode, so we need to change to a better engine to create a larger scale of cooperation mode content, and every hero will Add a new talent system to enhance character specific skills.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/People sell the sequels as DLC. Why do you dare to fight against Blizzard/b63779b89e5843d5b5a0ba09ada4bb5a.jpg" alt="People sell the sequels as DLC. Why do you dare to fight against Blizzard"><br>The most noteworthy content is that after the launch of watch 2, it can communicate with the client of watch 1. The old players with watch 1 can directly bring all their achievements and all the skin and decorative props to watch 2. In a period of time, the players with watch 2 can connect with the players of watch 1 Many players fight against each other, and soon after the launch of watch 2, the two games will merge the clients, thus replacing watch 1. Players with watch 1 can also play watch 2 directly after merging the client, but they can’t experience the cooperation mode of watch 2 and many new content added from watch 2. And that’s what many players question: since the first generation and the second generation will be able to merge their clients in the future, does it mean that this sequel is actually just the “new version” of “watch 1”, more like “watch 2.0” than “watch 2”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/People sell the sequels as DLC. Why do you dare to fight against Blizzard/6a7d93282e6f4642905b149c49f689cd.jpg" alt="People sell the sequels as DLC. Why do you dare to fight against Blizzard"><br>At least according to the existing intelligence, the players’ response to this sequel seems to be less intense. Although Blizzard has repeatedly stressed that this is a sequel, it looks like a super large DLC in any way, and it is still paid. According to blizzard, the content of watch 2 is much larger than that of a DLC, and even more than that of a generation. However, from the point that the two game clients can be merged in the future, many people think that although watch 2 will have a linear process similar to 3a, it is still the additional content of the first generation of games, and the biggest difference between the two is really only Whether there is PVE mode or not, but as a game focusing on multi player battle, no matter what kind of content is added, its focus will be more on online content than other modes.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/People sell the sequels as DLC. Why do you dare to fight against Blizzard/f02d36e328f846a095d4c3c147ea90da.jpg" alt="People sell the sequels as DLC. Why do you dare to fight against Blizzard"></p>
<h1 id="Familiar"><a href="#Familiar" class="headerlink" title="Familiar"></a>Familiar</h1><p>Jeff Kaplan, the game director of watch 2, once said that he had played many games, and there was no DLC of any game that could be compared with watch 2. In fact, the content of watch 2 is basically the same as that of a 3A game. It also provides a lot of new content for players, but the core playing method and system of the game are basically the same as that of the ontology Yes. From many players who have experienced watch 2 demo at present, we can know that, at least in the current state, although only PvE content can be experienced in demo, the shooting feel, skill release and even operation mode of watch 2 are basically consistent with the previous work, and the more intuitive difference is that the overall style of the game changes from the original cartoon style to the realistic style Close up. This kind of promotion mode of watch 2 is not uncommon, and it can even be said that it has some familiar feelings. The current big fire escape game “night of fortress” also uses PvP and PVE mode, and PVE needs to pay extra for purchase.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/People sell the sequels as DLC. Why do you dare to fight against Blizzard/6ef1572766b8434f91a69609ce1a13d3.jpg" alt="People sell the sequels as DLC. Why do you dare to fight against Blizzard"><br>The original “night of the fortress” is a kind of survival game built by many people, which can quickly build buildings and fight with zombies as the selling point, and then because of the popularity of the big escape mode, the “night of the fortress” also added the big escape mode for itself, which did not expect that their main construction system combined with the big escape to form a wonderful chemical reaction, so this Previously, there was no propaganda means for the popularity of the cold game overnight, and now the volume of Fortress night has far exceeded its original PvE content, but players can still choose to pay to unlock to experience different game content. Obviously, “watch 2” is the opposite of “night of the fortress”. The sale of the new mode of the game alone does not affect the players who have “watch 1” to experience the battle of many people in “watch 2”, but it is just a continuation.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/People sell the sequels as DLC. Why do you dare to fight against Blizzard/8e82394434784061aede0f540b30cdc2.jpg" alt="People sell the sequels as DLC. Why do you dare to fight against Blizzard"><br>The so-called sequels rarely replace the old ones with the new ones. Only some online games will claim that they have launched a sequel when the big version is updated. These online games usually adopt the operation mode of free downloading of props and charging fees, and the new version also replaces the old version. In recent years, service-oriented 3A games have become popular, such as destiny and the whole territory blockade. But it’s a pity that most of them lost their popularity only one year later. Then, they launched a series of “destiny 2” or “whole territory blockade 2” with the same playing method but different content. At first, many people thought that there was no sequel to these games The significance of “watch 2” is that even though it should only be the former DLC, the fact is that both the system and mechanism between the new work and the old work are completely different from the former, not only the scale that can be modified only through updating, but also the play experience is quite different. Obviously, “watch 2” claims to be a sequel, but the scale is far less than the level of these games.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/People sell the sequels as DLC. Why do you dare to fight against Blizzard/fa1e0377c87347c6b72c0f1f964c72c1.jpg" alt="People sell the sequels as DLC. Why do you dare to fight against Blizzard"><br>    concluding remarks<br>At least at present, anyone who comes to watch 2 will have such a view. In the early years, such a situation happened too many times, which is nothing more than a disguised version of marketing means. But in any case, there is still too little information about “watch 2”. There are too many contents about Blizzard that haven’t been released to the public. I also hope Blizzard can hit me in the face with practical actions. At present, Blizzard has not announced the specific operation mode of watch 2, nor announced the price of the game, or even came to take Blizzard to say that it has not decided, but at least it needs to be launched without offending the players, otherwise, the state of watch 2 will not be too different from Watch 1.</p>

He has a more well-known name in the game called notch, which is the man who created “my world”, a sand box game with great creativity and possibility, whose success is even greater than his own Imagine.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Selling the company is the thing he regrets the most.

The vicissitudes of my world and the founder notch"><br>Markus person, who players call “the creator”<br>Notch was born in Sweden, one of the five northern European countries. There is a small town named espin in the vast forest. The size of this town is not small, but it has a population of about 4000. When I was a child, notch was introverted. Children from other families all went out to play football and games in groups. Notch preferred to stay alone in the room and play with his LEGO toys. When notch was seven years old, his father brought a Commodore 128 personal computer back home, which made notch feel like a treasure. The computer became notch’s favorite partner besides toys.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Selling the company is the thing he regrets the most.

The vicissitudes of my world and the founder notch"><br>Commodore 128 PC<br>In my world’s autobiographical novel, notch’s childhood life is described as follows: when he was a child, notch often asked for leave to play computer games and learn to program on his own because of illness. At the age of 12, his parents divorced. There was only his father and sister in the family. His father was drunk and addicted to amphetamines (an anti fatigue drug), while his sister was addicted to drugs Pin chose to run away from home. Although the family situation was not very good, his mother was always very concerned about his son. Notch didn’t even finish high school and was at home. His mother knew that she liked programming, so she suggested that he use the Internet to learn programming courses at home, hoping that he could have the conditions to pursue his dream in the future. After learning, 24-year-old notch joined king, the game developer of candy legend, for four years. In these four years, notch not only participated in many game development from the company, but also undertook many other projects, the most famous of which is MMORPG game Wurm online.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Selling the company is the thing he regrets the most.

The vicissitudes of my world and the founder notch"><br>Sandbox MMORPG Wurm Online</p>
<h1 id="virtual-sandbox"><a href="#virtual-sandbox" class="headerlink" title="virtual sandbox"></a>virtual sandbox</h1><p>With King’s reputation in the game industry not rising and the company’s scale gradually expanding, notch rarely has the opportunity to undertake these “extra fast” private jobs. In notch, his freedom is limited, so he decided to quit and try to make a game himself. Notch hopes to make a sandbox game similar to dwarf fortress, and even the name is a salute game. The game is mainly played by reclaiming mines. At the same time, players can collect resources and use the materials at hand to randomly build various buildings in the game world, just like the Lego building blocks he played as a child.<br>In only one week, this prototype version has been completed. Due to the limited technical force, the content of the game is somewhat different from the version envisaged by notch. This is a 3D world composed of cubes, which should be a sandbox game in essence, but the players can do very little in this game, just like building blocks, it will be different It’s just a random combination of material blocks, so notch released his work to TIG source to try to communicate with other netizens and players in technology, which is the first public version of the game, 0.0.11a.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Selling the company is the thing he regrets the most.

The vicissitudes of my world and the founder notch"><br>Earliest version screen<br>The opinions given by the community determine the future trend of the game to a great extent, such as providing all the squares in the game to the players for arbitrary creation, or adding exploration elements to make it a survival oriented adventure game. In later versions, notch added the concept of alternation of day and night, collecting materials as much as possible during the day to build various facilities, with the purpose of resisting the attacks of monsters at night. From a certain point of view, these designs not only have the feeling of survival game, but also have the style of “Legend of Zelda” series as a whole. Because notch’s artistic skill is not good, he is very handy to use the game style of pixel style material and cube. After several adjustments and modifications, the game is just trying to play It’s a little interesting.<br>What is worth mentioning most is that since all the things in the game are presented in the image of cube, the player can regard each cube as a pixel point, so with the help of the construction mode, the player can use the cube of any material to build at will.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Selling the company is the thing he regrets the most.

The vicissitudes of my world and the founder notch"><br>Various buildings can be made up of various blocks</p>
<h1 id="chance-coincidence"><a href="#chance-coincidence" class="headerlink" title="chance coincidence"></a>chance coincidence</h1><p>Notch didn’t invest a penny in the promotion of the game. Thanks to its active and game forums from the beginning, it has attracted a considerable number of people’s attention. The game, which is still to be improved, and the first public version went online soon after, began to sell at a price of $6.00. Almost every day, hundreds of people pay for this seemingly novel game. With a little money, notch established mojang with his colleague Jacob poser in King studio, which means “gadget” in Swedish.<br>“My world” is like a virus, which is constantly expanding its audience, gradually spreading from the Internet to all parts of the world. At first, notch wanted to use the money he was coming to pay for one or two people’s follow-up updates and improvements with the help of the game. But now this scene is something he never dreamed of. When he has influence and income, he naturally needs to speed up the tour Only one or two people are not enough to update the play, and the far-reaching income has burst his paypal for a while, limiting the transaction.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Selling the company is the thing he regrets the most.

The vicissitudes of my world and the founder notch"><br>“My world” became a hit in a flash. The main work of the studio in the later stage was all around the update and revision of the game. Its creative playing methods and infinite possibilities made it an independent game suitable for the young and the old. With the deepening of the update, the game itself was no longer attached to the surface content. The addition of mechanism and red stone circuit made it possible to The game is full of many physical elements, and even the role of education and entertainment.<br>For children, in this game, they can not only learn a lot of knowledge, but also connect with the practical application of common sense of life. Therefore, many parents are very relieved to let their children try this game. Now, the total sales volume of my world is about to exceed 200 million, which is closely followed by the depth of Tetris. It is impossible for anyone to imagine that a game made by heart can achieve such success. The success of “my world” has attracted the attention of big companies, and its own value can not be underestimated. The rich Microsoft directly offered us $2.5 billion to purchase the ownership of mojang studio and “my world”, and in the face of such a high price, notch is also a very dry and crisp decision to sell the company.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Selling the company is the thing he regrets the most.

The vicissitudes of my world and the founder notch"><br>End of<br>Why does notch do this? Maybe it’s because he grew up in a poor family and lived a poor life. He wanted a large sum of money enough for him to spend the rest of his life enjoying happiness. After selling the company, notch also left the company to live a happy life. With this huge sum, he bought a $70 million mansion in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles. This mansion is very popular with a number of international superstars. It can see the Pacific Ocean from the center of Los Angeles all the time.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Selling the company is the thing he regrets the most.

The vicissitudes of my world and the founder notch"><br>Notch’s Mansion<br>However, with money, notch doesn’t seem to live the happy life he expected. He finds that he is still reluctant to part with my world for the company he created by himself. It’s like a lovelorn feeling. Although he gets what he wants most, he also loses what is most important to him at the same time.</p>

    <title>Playing a dizzy, difficult to understand the plot of the puzzle game portal, why can it succeed</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/Playing%20a%20dizzy,%20difficult%20to%20understand%20the%20plot%20of%20the%20puzzle%20game%20portal,%20why%20can%20it%20succeed/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I usually like to try all kinds of puzzle games with different styles, no matter it’s text, action or terror. I seldom download popular competitive games or leisure games on my mobile phone. I often install some puzzle games with burning brain most of the time, as “reading before sleep” for a while before I go to bed.<br>Puzzle games are just like cooking. You can fry eggs and then fry potatoes. They are actually all kinds of games. For example, when you see an iron box screwed by a screw, you will think of finding a screwdriver. When you see a strange arrangement, you will think of whether it will be a password. If you often play puzzle games, you will be able to solve most puzzle games The way to solve the mystery is as clear as your fingers.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Playing a dizzy, difficult to understand the plot of the puzzle game portal, why can it succeed/d98493dc6b4d46c7aae8aa639d180ebd.jpg" alt="Playing a dizzy, difficult to understand the plot of the puzzle game portal, why can it succeed"><br>The brain hole of the puzzle game is only produced by rust Lake<br>The portal series that we are going to talk about this time is a very unique existence in the puzzle game. It is a puzzle game that goes beyond the normal routine, but it must be combined with common sense to solve puzzles. It is very easy to understand. It uses its own unique system and style to show the puzzle shape that can only be realized in the portal Type. It’s hard for you to describe the excellence of this game with others. Even if you can explain it clearly, it’s hard to attract other players successfully.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Playing a dizzy, difficult to understand the plot of the puzzle game portal, why can it succeed/28df8eda325945feb7435950805b8b52.jpg" alt="Playing a dizzy, difficult to understand the plot of the puzzle game portal, why can it succeed"></p>
<h1 id="unknown-Pu"><a href="#unknown-Pu" class="headerlink" title="unknown Pu"></a>unknown Pu</h1><p>One day in 2005, Robin Walker was invited to participate in the career development day organized by dijibon Institute of technology in the United States. This is an annual activity held by dijibon Institute of technology, inviting professionals from all walks of life to teach experience to students. For students, this is undoubtedly the best time to find a job.<br>Walker is a game producer. After the experience sharing session, he chose to visit the students’ works. At that time, a small group of people stopped Walker and showed his works to Walker: this small group called themselves “nuclear monkey software”, and their works to Walker were called “narbacular drop”. The play method of the game is to control a princess trapped in the dungeon, use two conveyor doors that can be pasted on any plane, enter from this door and come out from another door, players need to use this prop to escape from the dungeon.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Playing a dizzy, difficult to understand the plot of the puzzle game portal, why can it succeed/ee65a919294a4a418e7347e473bfc22e.jpg" alt="Playing a dizzy, difficult to understand the plot of the puzzle game portal, why can it succeed"><br>3D independent games were not common in those days<br>This play method is very novel, but it’s only a relatively novel play method. The process is very short, there are only six puzzles, and even the saving function is not available. For walker, it’s not enough to attract other people’s attention, so he just left a name card for the “nuclear monkeys” and left in a hurry.<br>A year after that, the game won the student display award at the 2006 Independent Games Festival. Just as the members of “nuclear monkey” were immersed in the joy of winning the award, the man named Walker found them again and asked, “would you like to come to valve? We can talk. It turns out that Robin walker is the producer of the “army fortress” series. The concept of “Narcissus drop” attracted the V club, and hired all the members of “nuclear monkey” to the headquarters of V club. With the help of V club, they developed the game called “portal” with the concept of “Narcissus drop”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Playing a dizzy, difficult to understand the plot of the puzzle game portal, why can it succeed/17f1571a77c447f4be661e7c3676fe4a.jpg" alt="Playing a dizzy, difficult to understand the plot of the puzzle game portal, why can it succeed"><br>Members of “nuclear monkey”, even if they go to V club, never more than 10 people</p>
<h1 id="a-single-tree"><a href="#a-single-tree" class="headerlink" title="a single tree"></a>a single tree</h1><p>The core of the game is to escape from the dungeon, while to the portal, the core of the game is to escape from the laboratory; in the portal, only one enemy is the devil, and in the portal, only one enemy is called glados. In this way, we can see how similar the two concepts are. At first, the portal didn’t get the right to sell alone, but was bundled into the promotion game “the orange box” of V club, which was presented free of charge in the form of small games. However, the portal, with its own high quality, defeated numerous 3A masterpieces, and won more than 30 game awards, becoming the most in 2007 after “half life 2: Chapter 2” Big black horse.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Playing a dizzy, difficult to understand the plot of the puzzle game portal, why can it succeed/6492a61f237345f18ff616eafe69c9b0.jpg" alt="Playing a dizzy, difficult to understand the plot of the puzzle game portal, why can it succeed"><br>“One box, five games”<br>Careful players may find that there is almost no HUD in the portal except for the standard star. Its very clean UI and the color matching of “blue, white and orange” give people a very refreshing feeling. Players who have played the first person Parkour game “the edge of the mirror” should be able to feel the same feeling. The overall art style is very unified, and the clean picture and the sense of Technology The combination of scenes is enough to be one of the key words of the portal.<br>The collocation of the main colors will directly affect the players’ accurate memory of a game. It can become a representative element of the game, not only the content but also the color. For example, when we talk about blue and yellow, we can think of the radiation series. Red and white are easy to think of the assassin’s creed, while blue, white and orange are easy to think of the portal.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Playing a dizzy, difficult to understand the plot of the puzzle game portal, why can it succeed/5c16b5d3aa1142baa96edc209f977028.jpg" alt="Playing a dizzy, difficult to understand the plot of the puzzle game portal, why can it succeed"><br>The overall style of the game is very simple, there is no other redundant content<br>In fact, the plot of the game is very obscure and unclear. Therefore, although there are only three characters in the two works of the series, the protagonist, the terminal glados and the chatterbox Whitley, most of the time, the dialogue in the game will let the players understand or not.<br>The game cleverly uses the environment narration, adds the deliberately designed words or patterns in each corner of the game, and combines the very representative scenes and artistic styles in the above, even in addition to solving puzzles, it will make the players interested in the world beyond the puzzles, and generate the desire to explore. The plot of the game is difficult to understand at first, but when you finish the game once and know the process and strategy of the game, and then look back at the plot of the game again, you will find a surrealism story full of all kinds of bad tastes.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Playing a dizzy, difficult to understand the plot of the puzzle game portal, why can it succeed/f50a88c18cd04f3e8b1ea5d6503a1f4b.jpg" alt="Playing a dizzy, difficult to understand the plot of the puzzle game portal, why can it succeed"><br>The first generation of glados was bombed and the second generation was awakened by the protagonist. I don’t know how the players feel<br>These are all the contents beyond the riddle solving. Since the key of the riddle solving game is naturally still on the riddle solving body, the game is carried out from the perspective of the first person, and gives the player a gun that can “open the door” on the plane. This gun has no killing power, only two functions of lifting heavy objects and opening the door.<br>A transport gun, a closed space, so in fact, the whole game is like one after another “secret room escape”, but with the help of the super group physical effect of the “sourcs” engine and the unique use of the transport gun, the whole secret room escape becomes more “three-dimensional”, which is different from the previous use of props to find the way and then open the exit, but most of the time Props and exits are all in front of you. How to reach the past is the key to the puzzle. In nature, it has changed from “finding props” to “finding the way”, covering a wider range. Therefore, the plasticity of the game has also become stronger, and sometimes there is not only one way to pass.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Playing a dizzy, difficult to understand the plot of the puzzle game portal, why can it succeed/ca90615a8f2f4d46997babfb62178993.jpg" alt="Playing a dizzy, difficult to understand the plot of the puzzle game portal, why can it succeed"><br>The two generation of gel was also designed by students from DigiPen Institute of Technology, and then joined the V society.<br>    concluding remarks<br>The portal series has never been widely publicized, and there is almost no strong commercial atmosphere in it. In other words, it is not a game developed to make money, but more to express the brand-new thinking of V club on the game industry: it has proved to the world that good ideas are enough to defeat high-cost 3A masterpieces, and good plots do not have to pass Dialogue driven, a good puzzle game is not only one way of design.<br>Many distinctive elements have made the portal series a success, which gives the game industry a new way of thinking. It’s not hard for us to find that there is never a lack of revolutionary elements and ideas in the game developed by V society. Nowadays, the development level of the game industry is almost the same average standard, and the ideas for the game are also different. Maybe in the process of exploring new ideas, V Society has lost its direction and inspiration, otherwise, why G can’t count three?</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>I don’t know when many independent games or mobile games begin to define themselves as “rogue like games”. For the players who first come into contact with this new word, they may not understand what it means, but for those who come into contact with it, they may be able to understand how much rogue like is. When we usually play games, we are eager for a work we like. Its content should be rich enough, its playability should be strong enough, and the whole process should keep a fresh game experience, so as to maximize the life of the game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Roguelike game is not omnipotent though it has infinite possibilities/e8e4946afb9549d99a5556a7679951f8.jpg" alt="Roguelike game is not omnipotent though it has infinite possibilities"><br>It’s not just the players who think that, but the game manufacturers who don’t want to rely on a game can eat for several years. Through the market survey, it is found that players are very interested in the game full of randomness, and there was such a game full of randomness a long time ago. Although it is small, it is just in line with the appetite of players. It is not only time-saving and labor-saving to make such a game without worrying about the problem that the content is not rich enough. Isn’t it nice to kill two birds with one stone? In fact, even if it is random, the market is full of all kinds of rogue like games, which have begun to make the players feel aesthetic fatigue.</p>
<h1 id="“XXLike？”"><a href="#“XXLike？”" class="headerlink" title="“XXLike？”"></a>“XXLike？”</h1><p>In today’s game field, especially in the stand-alone field, we see the titles of game types such as “soul like”, “Galaxy demon city like”. These “xxlike” are “like XX game” as its name implies, while “like rogue” is “like rogue” as its name implies.<br>Rogue is an adventure game developed by Mike toyes and Gran wichman on UNIX system in 1980. It’s a luxury for a computer game in 1980s to have an image. The game image of rogue is very simple, but it’s surrounded by various characters into a variety of inexplicable graphics. Players control a symbol “@” and surround it with characters The target is the deepest talisman in the dungeon.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Roguelike game is not omnipotent though it has infinite possibilities/a2001a549488413ca78ed06436cc0801.jpg" alt="Roguelike game is not omnipotent though it has infinite possibilities"><br>“Chen” is the channel and “+” is the entrance and exit. All the pictures of adventure depend on your imagination<br>It seems that this game is similar to other adventure games at that time, but the two producers are a little lazy. They don’t want to spend a lot of time and energy on the level design of the game, so they think of using code to first make up various different scenes, and then using code to make them randomly according to certain rules. Every time the player dies, the world will be made Disappear, and then regenerate into a new game world.<br>The design of the first two is just for their own convenience, but inadvertently they invented a game mode. Every time a player dies, the game regenerates a new world, which means that every time the game is played, it has a different experience. In the most exaggerated form, it greatly enhances the life of the game, and the freshness covers the frustration derived from failure The more you play, the more addictive you become.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Roguelike game is not omnipotent though it has infinite possibilities/2faf357897c64e388ea0673f3fffe495.jpg" alt="Roguelike game is not omnipotent though it has infinite possibilities"><br>The success of rogue has also inspired many other manufacturers. Like rogue, games that use randomly generated worlds are also called “rogue like games” by players. Although the playability of this game mode is very strong, but from another point of view, the death penalty of rogue like is also very severe. The death of rogue is irreversible. If you play in an archive for a long time, you will see the end, but there is a strange thing you can’t beat. Once you die, it means that all you have done before will be wasted.<br>In this regard, some manufacturers choose to adjust this mechanism, such as adding the function of archiving, while others choose to keep this setting, aiming at the difficulty of keeping the game for hard core players. So, although roguelike game has a high playability, it is also a kind of hard core game, and not everyone can accept it.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Roguelike game is not omnipotent though it has infinite possibilities/52196ccb3eb04c24b5f8fd6f83f68db7.jpg" alt="Roguelike game is not omnipotent though it has infinite possibilities"><br>Roguelike’s masterpiece “dwarf fortress” is the victim of this “definition”</p>
<p>#Different ways do not conspire<br>As mentioned above, because of the hard core of the game style, there are not many people who know but are willing to try, which makes the game type in a small crowd state.<br>Before that, the definition of roguelike game by the players’ group was: a roguelike game must have the same elements as rogue, and even the characters and pictures used due to insufficient functions are also the elements that roguelike game must have, otherwise it cannot be called roguelike. This makes the subsequent roguelike game subject to considerable constraints. If you want to upgrade the screen, you can’t upgrade it. These so-called “hard core players” are really pretentious.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Roguelike game is not omnipotent though it has infinite possibilities/15f573ad2b4f4ed0a62739c7d671d748.jpg" alt="Roguelike game is not omnipotent though it has infinite possibilities"><br>Roguelike nethack with network online function<br>In 2008, the fans and developers of roguelike game held a meeting in Germany. In this meeting, they discussed the standard definition of roguelike game again: randomly generated world at the beginning of each game; death can’t be revived; players and NPC take turns to act (turn system); map layout is grid like; fight doesn’t need to enter the special battle interface; freedom can’t be too low, angle The color attribute is customized by the player; the monster does not need to be set except for the basic value; the game world needs to explore by itself, and the backplane is useless here.<br>This definition has aroused the dissatisfaction of many developers. No one has the qualification for what they say. Integrity is the golden age of independent games. More and more high-quality independent games begin to appear on the market. These former roguelike developers decided to join the independent game camp and develop a new one Type of game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Roguelike game is not omnipotent though it has infinite possibilities/072e22a0325348159f6b140e9cf17721.jpg" alt="Roguelike game is not omnipotent though it has infinite possibilities"><br>Sandbox masterpiece my world is inspired by dwarf fortress</p>
<p>#”Lite” following the trend<br>When the randomness of roguelike is combined with other game types, infinite possibilities are derived. According to the verifiable data, the first non roguelike game that uses the mechanism similar to roguelike is spelunky, an independent game launched in 2009. This is a 2D board game. The map of the game, like roguelike, uses death to regenerate randomly There will never be the same level.<br>There are not many Roguelike elements in cave exploration, so they call this game mode “RogueLite”, which is the common type in the market. In the eyes of those traditional roguelike players, the game may be pediatrics and non entry, but in fact, once launched, it has attracted the attention of many players. It seems that the freshness generated by this level at random has not appeared in the market for a long time. The last well-known game was Diablo 2 nine years ago.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Roguelike game is not omnipotent though it has infinite possibilities/5f85688f6ffc4b208bad255f0158c1c5.jpg" alt="Roguelike game is not omnipotent though it has infinite possibilities"><br>The painting style of cave exploration is very fresh<br>The success of “cave exploration” has set off a lot of waves in the independent game circle. Other independent game producers have found various possibilities, and many high-quality roguelite games have appeared in the market successively, among which many works have been tried by the author himself. As a result, an unexpected situation has emerged, that is, following the trend. For a while, almost all independent game studios were developing roguelite games, and there were all kinds of mixed works, which made the players feel aesthetic fatigue for roguelite for a short time.<br>Jonathan Broll, an independent game producer I like very much, once said, “when you peel off the shell of a game and only examine the core playing methods of the game, it’s clear whether the game is worth playing or not.” Obviously, many independent games under the flag of roguelike on the market can’t not only afford such inspection, but also can’t even type their names correctly.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Roguelike game is not omnipotent though it has infinite possibilities/eb0bef930b694a52bd63d1d218c2e8d4.jpg" alt="Roguelike game is not omnipotent though it has infinite possibilities"><br>Raguelite independent game “the union of Isaac”<br>These games did not inherit the soul of their predecessors, but simply put a bunch of messy mechanisms into the randomly generated map, and then set up harsh death penalty, which seems to be a “hard core game” that needs to be studied hard. The actual content of the upstream play is very thin, and the playability has no achievements.<br>Some people may say that it’s not easy for them to make a game because of the lack of manpower in the studio, but that doesn’t mean that they can play such a sentiment card to launch a substandard work. The famous independent game “please show me the documents”, “the return of Oberlin” is even developed by one person; the popular independent game “super carnivorous boy” has a super long game Process and very sophisticated level design are only two cooperative development. Independent game making is not an excuse for rough game making.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Roguelike game is not omnipotent though it has infinite possibilities/2981f5c013d24bac9999cc007666001c.jpg" alt="Roguelike game is not omnipotent though it has infinite possibilities"><br>It’s hard to imagine that “the return of Oberlin” is a game with a huge plot, and it comes from one person<br>    concluding remarks<br>Every game type is evolving and evolving, even the smallest. Roguelite provides a new idea for the development of the game market. We can find a little shadow of roguelite in many independent games or even 3A masterpieces we usually play. Although it is a mode full of infinite possibilities, it should never be a shield to block the rough game. Even the best knife should play in its most appropriate place The biggest effect is that it’s not realistic to use a crosshead screwdriver to screw a word screw. In a good direction, roguelite has successfully entered the public’s field of vision by following the trend, completely separated from the small circle, and has the opportunity to let more players feel its charm.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>Music game has a game circle that is neither big nor small. People who like it will be trapped in it, and people who don’t like it will absolutely despise it. The playing method of music games is usually not complicated, and the difficulty of development is not too high. Most music games are mainly based on strike. Therefore, it is only necessary to have enough excellent music lineup and make excellent and reasonable music score to form a music game with not low quality.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Slow down, it's not a good thing. the winning rule of Taiwan game studio Leia/c88c893ba3514daaa07a04808053375e.jpg" alt="Slow down, it&#39;s not a good thing. the winning rule of Taiwan game studio Leia"><br>When it comes to music games, mainstream players may mention such world-renowned works as “the future of the first sound: the singer’s plan” or “taiguda Ren”. If it is put in the domestic market, it will mention the same name: Leia. This studio from Taiwan started by developing music games on mobile platforms. With its unique game style and excellent production quality, it enjoys a high reputation throughout China. After trying to make other kinds of works, they have also achieved good reputation. Now they will bring a new work, which is another attempt and challenge for the new type.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Slow down, it's not a good thing. the winning rule of Taiwan game studio Leia/73692cba8b534d6592d7f8597faba1e2.jpg" alt="Slow down, it&#39;s not a good thing. the winning rule of Taiwan game studio Leia"></p>
<h1 id="“omnivorous”-people-and-“omnivorous”-companies"><a href="#“omnivorous”-people-and-“omnivorous”-companies" class="headerlink" title="“omnivorous” people and “omnivorous” companies"></a>“omnivorous” people and “omnivorous” companies</h1><p>One of the founders and CEO of Leia company is youmingyang, who has been in touch with video games since he was very young. Youmingyang’s father is a programmer, so his family has been equipped with a computer for a long time. At that time, when the Apple II home computer was famous in the digital field in the 1980s, it was thanks to this condition that youmingyang’s Enlightenment tour The platform is Apple II.<br>At that time, most of the Games were from overseas markets. Neither Taiwan nor the mainland had a few works that could be carried on the table. Therefore, if you want to play games on a PC, you can only buy floppy disks or disks handed down from overseas, and there is no Chinese. If you know English well, you can only guess by yourself if you can’t speak English. For a Taiwanese boy who is only four or five years old, it’s like talking to foreigners on a zero basis if he wants to play a game that is almost full of text in his early years. But you Mingyang still relies on himself to guess and figure out how to play one game after another. It’s in this situation that he comes up with the idea of playing a game in the future.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Slow down, it's not a good thing. the winning rule of Taiwan game studio Leia/e16ae4d713844d82b1eb46894b129041.jpg" alt="Slow down, it&#39;s not a good thing. the winning rule of Taiwan game studio Leia"><br>Small and simple Apple II is favored by enterprises<br>In addition to playing games, you Mingyang still likes music. In primary school, he studied piano like other children. Before junior high school, he liked classical guitar, so he practiced until university. To be sure, these two are his biggest hobbies. In his spare time, he also likes to see anime, read novels, and dabble in various types.<br>It is precisely because of his experience in various fields that he directly led to his positioning in the founding of Raya: including but not limited to music games, taking his most familiar field as the company’s business core, and other types of games can choose to try after accumulating experience. In fact, before youmingyang started the company with his small partners, they had done some arcade projects for a period of time, and the effect was not very ideal. But at least they learned the experience of entrepreneurship, just as smart phones began to enter the growth period, they also decided to do mobile games with this momentum, but they didn’t want to do the same games as other manufacturers.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Slow down, it's not a good thing. the winning rule of Taiwan game studio Leia/49dbbaba314c490c9afa4c30139559dc.jpg" alt="Slow down, it&#39;s not a good thing. the winning rule of Taiwan game studio Leia"><br>Photo of core members, Zuo Yi is famous for you</p>
<p>#Art and technology<br>At the beginning of rayark company’s establishment, the company set up four works, including two music games, one action game and one leisure game. Their first work is one of the two music games. Rayar named it “cytus”, which is still the most popular video game works on mobile platform. The style of cytus is similar to that of DJ Max technika, but it’s a special layout design for the particularity of mobile platform. Cytus is not as hot and dry as other music games. At first glance, the slow interface animation and the cold color matching of the whole sci-fi wind are not even a music game.<br>As mentioned at the beginning of the article, music game is a kind of category that says “the small is not the small, the public is not the public”, and the choice of this type of game is obviously not suitable for a just started game studio, and the famous of this game once explained that the reason why they choose to do music game is that they are relatively familiar with the field on the one hand, and then when they do the arcade business before I’ve had experience. Although the audio games are relatively small, the user group is usually loyal and stable. If we do well, it will soon spread in this not too large circle.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Slow down, it's not a good thing. the winning rule of Taiwan game studio Leia/4d02e3c28931438183ee50bbb83f9d76.jpg" alt="Slow down, it&#39;s not a good thing. the winning rule of Taiwan game studio Leia"><br>“Cytus”<br>It’s one of Leia’s business strategies to not rush for success and have a long-term vision. However, cytus exceeded their expectations and soon became the top of the hot sales list in various countries. It seems that they despised the mobile game, a market with a huge user base. With their unique style and excellent production, they even attracted many players who didn’t play video games, The scope of this field has been expanded.<br>Cytus is good at controlling the difficulty. Leisure players can enjoy the game, and core players can also get challenges in high difficulty. The subsequent release of “deemo” is based on the original design of a more people-friendly drop-down audio game. It tells a warm and moving story with the piano as the blueprint of the game. It is a very rare thing to add a plot in the music game, but the plot of “deemo” is definitely a bonus of the game, and this work reveals a sense of literature and art from the core, As a result, many players have entered Leia’s pit from this generation’s works. Deemo is also the most famous one of Leia’s works.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Slow down, it's not a good thing. the winning rule of Taiwan game studio Leia/eafdbea347e043059021e2c51b91f0f7.jpg" alt="Slow down, it&#39;s not a good thing. the winning rule of Taiwan game studio Leia"><br>“Deemo”<br>     balance<br>Later, Leia once launched the leisure game “Mandala”, science fiction action game “implosion explosion”, youth theme music game “voez lankong”, Mandala “is a completely free leisure game,” implosion explosion “is to pay for the purchase of the game body buy-out system, while” voez lankong “is to use the single buy-out system, each time trying to Different charging modes try to find out the mode that can satisfy the players and generate income. In the view of you Mingyang, the success of a game in the industry depends on three standards: enough players, enough income, and whether the game is fun or not. It is not easy to meet these three conditions at the same time. The game that can earn money is not necessarily fun, and the game that the players value highly is not necessarily able to earn money. So he decided to plan his own products for two different routes, one is to buy them out, the other is to buy them for free, and the work born under the planning of the latter is their first RPG game “Vientiane”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Slow down, it's not a good thing. the winning rule of Taiwan game studio Leia/6c802f90e5be44f0964e8699fadfbb72.jpg" alt="Slow down, it&#39;s not a good thing. the winning rule of Taiwan game studio Leia"><br>Implosion explosion<br>“Vientiane tale” is Leia’s first work operated in F2P mode, but it doesn’t mean that they can cut corners, whether it’s picture, special effect, plot or sound effect, it still maintains Leia’s consistent high standard, and a card like RPG game, “Vientiane tale” is not like other similar hand games, but only plays a side ball, Without physical strength, combat power and other settings, the game focuses on the plot shaping, and the playing method also tends to experience the plot and collect characters. Without too complex content, there are fewer pay points for games.<br>This approach is effective. In just one month, it has generated 100 million yuan of revenue for Leia, more than the revenue of all their previous single games. But as a work almost no different from single game, if there is no rich game content to support, the later content of the game will become boring, and these are not the main problems for Leia, their core is always kept in the plot and role content filling, because they do not want to stick the players to their games, just through the Capacity update to extend the vitality, if like other manufacturers as pure for money, then they would rather not do this game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Slow down, it's not a good thing. the winning rule of Taiwan game studio Leia/0ff183f4a64d448993f135390c8521b2.jpg" alt="Slow down, it&#39;s not a good thing. the winning rule of Taiwan game studio Leia"><br>The story of Vientiane<br>    concluding remarks<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Slow down, it's not a good thing. the winning rule of Taiwan game studio Leia/eb63047e4c3247d084f569f9b1e24ad7.jpg" alt="Slow down, it&#39;s not a good thing. the winning rule of Taiwan game studio Leia"><br>Mo: astray cell lost<br>To be fair, reya is really a rare game company in the market that focuses on the development of high-quality games, but also has a very conscientious operation. They can get their own place in today’s highly competitive market only by their original intention. This spirit is worth learning from the game manufacturers in our mainland. Today’s Leia is not only a game studio, but also an agent. The horizontal action game Mo: astray cell lost, which Leia first launched in cooperation with the third-party independent game studio, is about to be released on the PC side. I believe that with Leia’s reputation, this time it can still become a phenomenal pop-up work. Before that, each of their games Almost all of them can be called “hot money”.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>For a long time, the game works with medieval historical themes are very small in the whole field of video games, but in this field, we can also see many excellent works, such as the RPG works with extremely strong vitality, horse riding and killing series, or the real-time strategic game fortress series, which is dedicated to restoring the castle’s offensive and defensive war Even now, the product may be regarded as a masterpiece in addition to some outdated pictures. The core of this theme is to let players experience the real history in history, so the key point is “reality”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The 3A hit by a cavity of blood, born under paranoia, heaven save/c5bb045af4904c2a97e58084073ec394.jpg" alt="The 3A hit by a cavity of blood, born under paranoia, heaven save"><br>2010 horse riding and killing: Battle Group<br>There are not many works to carry out this in the end. The reason why the above works are outstanding is mainly due to the highly restoration of the real middle ages. However, there are only a few serious 3A scale works that can be found. But it doesn’t mean that there is no such a typical RPG game as the kingdom of heaven: salvation, but it’s amazing that the work that looks like 3A can’t be more than 3A actually comes from an independent studio.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The 3A hit by a cavity of blood, born under paranoia, heaven save/56344c034daf4f178fb459e1c3cbf497.jpg" alt="The 3A hit by a cavity of blood, born under paranoia, heaven save"></p>
<h1 id="small-workshops-have-great-advantages"><a href="#small-workshops-have-great-advantages" class="headerlink" title="small workshops have great advantages"></a>small workshops have great advantages</h1><p>About eight years ago, in a bar in Prague, the Czech capital, two men were planning to make some “big moves”, which may be the most important decision for them in their life. The two men planned to set up a game studio, and tried to gather all the excellent local video game producers together to develop a middle world video game In view of the original intention of the company, they gave the studio a very suitable name: warhorse. Although the studio has been established for more than eight years, and only one game has been launched, the two men who set up the studio are not simple. One is Daniel vavla, who has ten years of experience in game production before. He once worked in the Czech branch of 2K developer, and the first two works of the famous retro open world action game “brothers of the four seas” It’s from him; the other is Martin Krama, who previously worked in the interaction between codmaster and Bohemia and participated in the development of operation flash point and armed assault.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The 3A hit by a cavity of blood, born under paranoia, heaven save/2eedb98b1e3f4a87b59070a7df8616a9.jpg" alt="The 3A hit by a cavity of blood, born under paranoia, heaven save"><br>Daniel vafra on the left and Martin Krama on the right<br>All the friends who have played know that with the high-quality production quality, the first two works of the four seas Brothers series have a high popularity in the game circle. This game also makes a lot of income for 2K, and Daniel, the producer, also makes a lot of money from it, but he is not happy about it, but he still feels tired of it, because it seems to him that the atmosphere of a large company It’s not suitable for him. He thinks that all the tasks assigned to him by the company are not what he would like to do. Although Daniel has done them well, if he can arouse his creative desire, these works can even go to a higher level.<br>In Daniel’s mind, he always wanted to make a realistic RPG with medieval themes, and it must be the kind of open world and hard core system. However, we need to know that although there are not a few game developers in Europe, especially independent game companies, so the video game industry is relatively developed, but it seems not so comfortable in the Czech Republic alone. There are only a few game manufacturers in this place, so it is not easy to recruit investors for this just started studio.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The 3A hit by a cavity of blood, born under paranoia, heaven save/f437c0a48d494830a1d92237941b2b18.jpg" alt="The 3A hit by a cavity of blood, born under paranoia, heaven save"><br>2010 brothers of the four seas 2<br>    gambling<br>In 2011, the video game industry is in a tuyere period. Many small and medium-sized studios have been either acquired or closed. However, for zhanma, a newly established studio, the prospect is not optimistic. Publishers and investors are very afraid to take risks. There will be people who are interested in Daniel’s project, but most of them have never been in the game field. Either they suggest Daniel not to make such a large-scale product, but to make a more profitable online game or hand game. For warhorses, this work is of great significance to them, so they do not want to These unsuitable investors have ruined the future of the game. Daniel visited major game publishers all over the world, and also looked for many investors. This search lasted for two years. In these two years, all kinds of expenses almost consumed Daniel’s savings, and even the studio could not continue. This made Daniel once fell into despair. Maybe he had to find a new job to make a living.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The 3A hit by a cavity of blood, born under paranoia, heaven save/bec79b7112c74a12b10bf708e2dceb05.jpg" alt="The 3A hit by a cavity of blood, born under paranoia, heaven save"><br>Daniel with white head<br>As described in other stories, there should always be a timely rain at this time to save the protagonist of the story, as well as the war horse studio. Just as Daniel was about to decide to give up his business career, their works were appreciated by a Czech rich man named Zdenek bakala, who decided to give seed financing to the war horse studio, which was regarded as a kind of Make a big bet of your own. This made Daniel ecstatic, then began to continue his plan, he used the money to build the studio, and began to enter the development stage of the game. As mentioned above, Daniel’s ambition is very huge. He wants to make a hard core game as real as possible. Every element in the game has appeared in the history, and the picture of the game must fit the times. He wants to make not only a world, but also a complete representation of history in the game, and let the players play with a The identity of nobody lives and takes risks in this world.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The 3A hit by a cavity of blood, born under paranoia, heaven save/25d6d03d0793459c9b52a332263409f1.jpg" alt="The 3A hit by a cavity of blood, born under paranoia, heaven save"><br>Early concept map</p>
<h1 id="strong-unsatisfactory"><a href="#strong-unsatisfactory" class="headerlink" title="strong unsatisfactory"></a>strong unsatisfactory</h1><p>However, two years later, the game is still in the early stage of development. Due to Daniel’s excessive pursuit of the details of the game, he has to add a variety of systems and mechanisms from the beginning of making the game demo, such as the length of the players’ meals and sleep, etc., and continue to polish them, so that in the early stage, he spent all the money given by the rich. Obviously, Daniel has a very huge ambition, if according to his imagination, it will be a large-scale 3A work, and the studio has only about 30 people and the economy is not sufficient, which is undoubtedly fantastic. Fortunately, their demo has reached the level of public release, so they decided to seek the help of the players and started crowdfunding on the Internet, with a goal of 500000 dollars. “If this goal cannot be achieved, then as those companies say, this game has no market, and we will give up this game,” Daniel said.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The 3A hit by a cavity of blood, born under paranoia, heaven save/0e974e29acec4e628cad6271db9e1afa.jpg" alt="The 3A hit by a cavity of blood, born under paranoia, heaven save"><br>The current members of warhorse studio<br>The game raised more than £ 1.1 million, more than four times the original target, and became the third game project in 2014 when KickStarter platform received funds. After that, warhorse studio got a second round of financing from the Czech rich man, so they finally had enough money to complete their vision. After four years of development, the game finally appeared in the sales interface of the store. If it starts from the project approval, the game took seven years to complete. The game is called “heaven: save”. It sold 1 million sets in just half a month after its launch, creating at least $50 million in revenue for the studio. Just like the name of the studio, it became the first “war horse” in 2018.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The 3A hit by a cavity of blood, born under paranoia, heaven save/c5b5ebc86d004832b2364be2a5f65ed1.jpg" alt="The 3A hit by a cavity of blood, born under paranoia, heaven save"><br>2018 heaven: saving<br>Although the effect of the game is considerable, the reputation of the game itself is very polarized. The good thing is that the game has a very real restoration for all aspects, including people’s life style and clothing matching, and even the combat system is also very realistic. Although it doesn’t look handsome or even a little clumsy, every move has a relevant experience According to historical records, even in modern times, a martial art named HEMA has developed.<br>At the beginning of the game’s sale, the bug and optimization of the game were also criticized by the players. Even in the eyes of many players, the game seemed to be unfinished. The whole game’s playing method was similar to the imitation version of “horse riding and killing” and “ancient scroll”. Due to the strong pursuit of truth, the difficulty of the game was relatively high. For many operation levels The players who are not good at it are not friendly.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The 3A hit by a cavity of blood, born under paranoia, heaven save/8118c58535494774aa5ccb23ecd8f628.jpg" alt="The 3A hit by a cavity of blood, born under paranoia, heaven save"><br>    concluding remarks<br>In my opinion, although the game “heaven: save” has a very close look to 3A works, it is only a kind of existence between 3a and independent games in essence. From the perspective of development industry, this is a “medieval” simulator with combat system, so the evaluation of the game is still acceptable and will not make people feel that there is anything wrong. The need for Tucao is Daniel’s style of work. Obviously, this game is absolutely not bad, but without the help of the rich, the game will never be done again.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The 3A hit by a cavity of blood, born under paranoia, heaven save/485c49f6c5d94bf6b00fac5d9fa82cfe.jpg" alt="The 3A hit by a cavity of blood, born under paranoia, heaven save"><br>Cryngine used in the game is not easy for everyone to control<br>Daniel’s ambition is a very good thing. This kind of spirit of playing games when he can’t afford to eat is really admirable. However, his ambition is to rise to the sky step by step. After all, although the employees are all experienced people, the studio is brand-new after all. He walks steadily and slowly step by step. It’s better to try small-scale works and consolidate the foundation of the studio Appropriate practices. Frankly speaking, the success of this game is attributed to those who have helped them. Fortunately, this game has been successful in the end. Otherwise, whether the studio can still have today is still unknown. The strength of warhorse studio can’t be underestimated, but I hope that they can make steady progress in the future, otherwise they will eventually fall into a rush In the mire.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>On November 27, American game company EA, its studio rebirth entertainment and Lucas film, the producer of science fiction movie star wars, jointly announced that its latest game, Star Wars Jedi: the fallen Samurai regiment, has become the most popular Star Wars game with the highest initial sales volume in history. At the same time, EA launched the best opening sales volume after reaching cooperation with Disney Star Wars.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The Star Wars Jedi, which EA sold out, once again perfectly explains what the real adaptation game is/d1d35d2db9a546f195ffaf41ea44f3fa.jpg" alt="The Star Wars Jedi, which EA sold out, once again perfectly explains what the real adaptation game is"><br>Recently, it has been a carnival for fans of Star Wars. First, the movie star wars: Mandalorians, which has been widely acclaimed, was officially launched, and then the game Star Wars Jedi was highly praised. Next month, the movie star wars 9 will be launched to usher in the official completion of the new Trilogy. Although the discussion degree of Star Wars Series in China is not very high, its reputation is resounding all over the world. Many people thought that “Star Wars Jedi” dared to sell at the same time as “death ran aground” for fear that the sales volume would die suddenly. In fact, they were slapped in the face. But to be fair, the success of “Star Wars Jedi” on the one hand has the support of IP, and On the other hand, the quality of the game itself is really excellent.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The Star Wars Jedi, which EA sold out, once again perfectly explains what the real adaptation game is/ca91b615eb674bbeb0c542b4b65a64f0.jpg" alt="The Star Wars Jedi, which EA sold out, once again perfectly explains what the real adaptation game is"><br>It is difficult to make a mistake.<br>EA signed a 10-year cooperation agreement with Disney, the copyright holder of star wars, as early as 2013. Since then, only EA has the qualification to develop Star Wars games. “Star Wars” series of games have appeared since the last century when video games were still in yadali period, but these games were not brilliant in that period when the film and television adaptation games were extremely rampant. EA did not invest in the development of related large-scale games after receiving “Star Wars” IP, but took the lead in launching a low-cost mobile game called “Star Wars: Galaxy and Britain” Xiong.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The Star Wars Jedi, which EA sold out, once again perfectly explains what the real adaptation game is/30ecdea661bf43d3a512b84e5ae30fb7.jpg" alt="The Star Wars Jedi, which EA sold out, once again perfectly explains what the real adaptation game is"><br>Star Wars: Galactic Heroes<br>Although mobile games made a lot of money for EA, the reputation of the game was not ideal. At that time, EA was carrying a lot of stigma. Two years later, dice, EA’s “Pro son” studio, took over the development of “Star Wars” game, and developed “Star Wars: the front line” on the scale of her own brand game “battlefield”, which is also the first time that the “Star Wars” series of games presented in front of players in a 3A posture.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The Star Wars Jedi, which EA sold out, once again perfectly explains what the real adaptation game is/2c8c4233cef9484eaefc72a9dc7e20cb.jpg" alt="The Star Wars Jedi, which EA sold out, once again perfectly explains what the real adaptation game is"><br>Star Wars: the front<br>In fact, although there are many fans of star wars, those who like to watch movies may not like to play games. After all, people who like star wars are no longer young. Some of them have never touched games since they contacted Star Wars. Therefore, although the popularity of film and television works is quite high, the performance of the game is very common. To a large extent, because the IP influence is too large, fans expect too much of the game, and then because of too many times of disappointment, they gradually lose confidence in the game series.<br>Even though the screen performance and battlefield atmosphere of Star Wars: the front line are well shaped, the depth and content of the game in various systems are a little thin, which leads to the game’s lack of popularity, which is still the same and fails to meet the players’ ideal standards. For developers, holding such a large amount of IP also means paying for expensive copyright fees. In today’s low-cost and high heat environment, this form of paying first and then making money is obviously no longer popular, which is why games adapted with famous IP are no longer common in recent years.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The Star Wars Jedi, which EA sold out, once again perfectly explains what the real adaptation game is/c0d7d92eab424b6ca3d58e97f386affa.jpg" alt="The Star Wars Jedi, which EA sold out, once again perfectly explains what the real adaptation game is"><br>Star Wars: Frontline 2</p>
<h1 id="flash-point"><a href="#flash-point" class="headerlink" title="flash point"></a>flash point</h1><p>Although the purchase price of copyright is very expensive, it is not a venture capital. Holding the copyright means that it can attract a group of fans in any case, at least ensure the sales volume of the game, and even save a sum of advertising costs. For a big IP like star wars, which is famous all over the world, the revenue is multiplied. The performance of two generations of works in Star Wars: front line series is not ideal, even EA’s reputation has declined because of the content purchased in the second generation. Many players and media even attack EA online: EA does not deserve the IP of Star Wars.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The Star Wars Jedi, which EA sold out, once again perfectly explains what the real adaptation game is/dbbeeda66ef247d6b05c23a1106c1549.jpg" alt="The Star Wars Jedi, which EA sold out, once again perfectly explains what the real adaptation game is"><br>In terms of EA, the public opinion of the hard to top players was later cancelled, and the open world Star Wars stand-alone game that had been handed over to EA Vancouver studio was under development. To a large extent, those who took over the development of the game were also hard to respond to the fans’ expectations, and a little carelessness would inevitably lead to failure. Many people think that the so-called IP adaptation game is to serve the fans who like the relevant IP independently, which is not only in the view of the players, but also in the view of many game developers. Therefore, most of these games only need to work hard on the parts expected by the players, and it’s no harm to make them rough in other places. Obviously, this is not the case A correct theory.<br>Although the world outlook and setting of Star Wars series are not complicated, they are also very large. It is not difficult to understand them, but it will take a long time to fully understand them. Therefore, Star Wars Jedi is not a game that passers-by can easily enter the pit. Its background setting and plot are closely related to the movie plot, and many settings in the game are consistent with the movie. Only those who have seen the movie can get the best game experience, while passers-by players may feel confused. This kind of feeling is like playing wizard 3 without playing the first two works of wizard. If you come out with a person with great weight in the previous work, you will not know who he is, so you will not feel the wonderful shaping of this bridge.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The Star Wars Jedi, which EA sold out, once again perfectly explains what the real adaptation game is/810b0ba33fb9483b93c42288b3c7408a.jpg" alt="The Star Wars Jedi, which EA sold out, once again perfectly explains what the real adaptation game is"><br>The core role of wizard 3, the king of wild hunting, is an important role since the second generation<br>In the history of game development, there are not many adapted games that can be called masterpieces, but almost every one can be regarded as a classic. For example, Batman: Arkham series, as a superhero game adapted from comics, is called the best adapted game in history by numerous fans. The reason why it can get such evaluation is that the design of the game is very considerate For players who don’t know much about Batman, there are detailed descriptions of the relevant stories and character building of several main characters. Even the weapons Batman uses in the battle are easy to understand. They focus on Batman’s own characteristics and the combination with the game content, giving players a sense that they are “playing” Batman rather than “controlling” Batman , in order to enhance the experience of the game rather than purely meet the expectations of fans, and “Star Wars Jedi” also achieved the same effect, will be recognized by the players.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The Star Wars Jedi, which EA sold out, once again perfectly explains what the real adaptation game is/6f2bec38f2a34d87bd512418e665428b.jpg" alt="The Star Wars Jedi, which EA sold out, once again perfectly explains what the real adaptation game is"><br>The peak of Batman game city of Arkham<br>In short, “Star Wars Jedi” meets all the expectations of a Star Wars fan for the adaptation of the game. The characters in the movie can kill the enemy with their lightsabers in handsome moves, or shoot back the laser from the enemy, use the force to hold the enemy’s throat and push down the cliff, or even use lightsabers to illuminate in dark places. These experiences can be realized in the game Now, it completely restores the experience of a real Jedi warrior, which rarely appeared in previous games.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The Star Wars Jedi, which EA sold out, once again perfectly explains what the real adaptation game is/1b5024b833224a17b0454d89a930d273.jpg" alt="The Star Wars Jedi, which EA sold out, once again perfectly explains what the real adaptation game is"><br>Running on the wall has the shadow of “Titan falls”<br>Many successful adaptation game cases have been placed in front of the players, so the players will have a fixed measurement for the evaluation standard of adaptation game, whether it is simply as a fan to know the consumption feelings of the game at a glance, but in front of those well-known IP, whether the audience group they belong to can remain rational is another matter. I hope to see more adaptation games with high quality and experience like Star Wars Jedi in the future. After all, consumer sentiment is not a sustainable development path.</p>

    <title>The application and performance of Parkour in the game, like the flow of water</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/The%20application%20and%20performance%20of%20Parkour%20in%20the%20game,%20like%20the%20flow%20of%20water/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Parkour, an extreme sport from France, is said to be the cheapest of all extreme sports, because it doesn’t need any hardware equipment, or even protection measures. It only needs your limbs to participate. But if an accident happens accidentally, the high medical expenses can also be compared with other extreme sports. Parkour is not only an ornamental sport, but also has the effect of strengthening body and improving personal reaction ability.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The application and performance of Parkour in the game, like the flow of water/7ea32bd25f6546d7abdded39b137467b.jpg" alt="The application and performance of Parkour in the game, like the flow of water"><br>Since parkour is so ornamental, why not put it into video games? After all, no matter how to say parkour is an extreme sport, its danger and difficulty are not low. It’s better to have a try in the virtual world than to have a try in person. It not only ensures safety, but also can feel the pleasure and stimulation of Parkour. Now we can see all kinds of unique skills in video games. In a flash, we can fly across the crowd and buildings. With the passage of time, there are more and more games with Parkour elements, and as time goes on, the styles become more and more different.<br>The origin of<br>Parkour movement, also known as “city gallop”, was initiated by several French soldiers during the Vietnam War. It was originally used to quickly shuttle in the battlefield in the most efficient and safe way of movement, and then became popular in Britain after 2000. Parkour has no clear definition and rules. It can be called Parkour as long as it relies on the body to assist with various facilities or obstacles, and runs, jumps and walks through them. Parkour has four main movement modes: sprint, jump, climb and roll. All Parkour movements are derived from these four movement modes. In this way, can we call it Parkour when we turn over the railings and jump into a puddle? (funny)<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The application and performance of Parkour in the game, like the flow of water/74baa46f6ea44607bdbf7457f45d4588.jpg" alt="The application and performance of Parkour in the game, like the flow of water"><br>When it comes to parkour, we have to mention such a person:   David bell  . Although Parkour became popular in the UK after 2000, it was fully developed by David.<br>David is a Frenchman. He likes to run and jump on the roof of the school when he is young. His father is a French soldier, so he was inspired by his father to create Parkour. David’s action design for parkour is influenced by Asian philosophy. According to him, parkour is “flowing like water”, free, fearless and free. David is not only the founder of parkour, but also an action actor in view of his flexible body method. The action crime movie violence block starred by David uses a lot of cool Parkour actions designed by him. I believe that the audience will be impressed by those handsome actions.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The application and performance of Parkour in the game, like the flow of water/b8aab6c9c72e4201a4e2d01c069f72e6.jpg" alt="The application and performance of Parkour in the game, like the flow of water"><br>David bell, founder of Parkour</p>
<h1 id="different-themes-and-performances"><a href="#different-themes-and-performances" class="headerlink" title="different themes and performances"></a>different themes and performances</h1><p>Up to now, parkour has many branches and categories, including those focusing on sports, those focusing on viewing, and even those integrating combat into Parkour. Since there are so many kinds of Parkour in reality, it’s not to be outdone in video games, but compared with the way of Parkour in reality, it seems more untested. Here are some categories that I have summed up by myself. There is no official definition. Please have a look.</p>
<ol>
<li>Classic Parkour<br>Classic parkour, also known as plain parkour, is not as gorgeous as the real Parkour. It pays more attention to the practicality and mobile efficiency when moving. It usually appears in the game types with a long story background. After all, there was no Parkour before 2000. As mentioned above, parkour game originated in France, and its founder is also a Frenchman, so it must be quite popular among Frenchmen. When it comes to French game manufacturers, then everyone will think of Ubisoft at the first time, and Ubisoft’s number of games containing Parkour elements is definitely one of the best in the whole game field.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The application and performance of Parkour in the game, like the flow of water/76582de16939441a80e771bca6e0fb36.jpg" alt="The application and performance of Parkour in the game, like the flow of water"><br>About Ubisoft’s Parkour game, the earliest one can be traced back to the early Ubisoft work Prince of Persia series. The action game Prince of Persia: sand of time released by Ubisoft in 2003 was a global sensation when it was launched. After all, before the birth of this work, there was no other game whose characters could be as agile as the protagonists in Prince of Persia. No matter running against the wall, jumping repeatedly or on the bar, everything is so flowing. Even if there is a mistake in parkour, you can use “sand of time” to backtrack the time, so as to avoid the mistake and achieve a perfect Parkour action. It is precisely because these flexible actions look like monkeys to outsiders, which makes Prince of Persia always have“ Persian monkey.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The application and performance of Parkour in the game, like the flow of water/2f09d762fb914826b6e309ef47b38658.jpg" alt="The application and performance of Parkour in the game, like the flow of water"><br>As we all know, due to the recession of the follow-up works of Prince of Persia series, Ubisoft has completely hidden this series, and the assassin’s Creed series has been born instead. The author doesn’t need to introduce too much about the fire of the assassin’s Creed series. It’s a novel theme and play method. The assassin’s Creed series has a function of “free running” in the past dynasties. In this state, the characters controlled by players can easily climb over most of the buildings and obstacles. After all, as assassins, they often have to walk between various buildings to hide their whereabouts, right I can’t even climb the wall. The Parkour action in Assassin’s creed is not ornamental, but it is very practical. It is based on this relatively simple Parkour system, which has derived the impressive signboard actions of “high altitude assassination” and “leap of faith”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The application and performance of Parkour in the game, like the flow of water/256e582eb3ed42df8014f8a5677bb11e.jpg" alt="The application and performance of Parkour in the game, like the flow of water"><br>The leap of faith is not realistic. Do not imitate it</li>
<li>Realistic Parkour<br>As the name implies, realistic parkour is just like the existence of Parkour in real life, and its functionality and appreciation are the same as reality. As far as I know, there is only one realistic Parkour game with modern background, which is called the edge of the mirror. “Edge of the mirror” is released by EA, and the first person Parkour game produced by dice, the developer of battlefield series, may be asked: with the first person running, jumping and rolling, won’t you faint? Yes, in fact, this game is very unfriendly to the players who are dizzy with 3D. After all, there are many Parkour actions in the game that are the same as the reality, and they often swim between the roof and the roof, which will not only dizzy 3D, but also make people dizzy at height. But it is worth mentioning that the artistic style of “the edge of the mirror” is just like her name, like a mirror, clean and clear.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The application and performance of Parkour in the game, like the flow of water/3c135dc3d462482eba124b7d264b2d2d.jpg" alt="The application and performance of Parkour in the game, like the flow of water"><br>Parkour joined in the battle is even more shocking<br>Another game with modern Parkour content is also the game of Ubisoft, which is known as “modern version of Assassin’s Creed” called “watchdog”. Although there was Parkour element in the early generation of the watchdog series, it was still a small thing compared with the assassin’s Creed series. After all, the background is modern, and it can no longer use the original methods to fight, so there is no need to scramble everywhere. And here’s watchdog 2. The protagonist of the second generation changed from the white uncle Eden pierce to the black brother Max haroway, so he has some street hip-hop attributes. As for body method, Marcus is much better than Aiden. Whether it’s back somersault, front somersault or back somersault, there’s a pattern. It’s much better than all the above works in terms of viewing.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The application and performance of Parkour in the game, like the flow of water/22d48317b20c44f1a7ed5d99a72adbfd.jpg" alt="The application and performance of Parkour in the game, like the flow of water"><br>Physical strength is more suitable for fighting</li>
<li>Super power Parkour<br>The so-called super power parkour is a Parkour posture realized by unrealistic means in reality, which can only stay in the fantasy. The most important role for Parkour to play is spider man. There are so many games made with the theme of spider man. However, in manwei spider man released last year, the most effective action of spider man is to swing spider silk. With the help of spider man’s ability, players can not only use spider silk to “swing”, but also cross various narrow gaps at high speed, or run directly on the wall. In the real sense, they can run as they want and jump as they want.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The application and performance of Parkour in the game, like the flow of water/3774af580e1449379e1de74100532ee9.jpg" alt="The application and performance of Parkour in the game, like the flow of water"><br>Another character worth mentioning is Alex Mercer, the protagonist of the classic action game sadism. Because of its infection with the virus, it has acquired a very destructive power. It can not only fly on the eaves and walk on the walls, but also make the everywhere in the world a mess. The cool and cold shape, the ability to destroy the sky and the earth, and the ability to jump up and down the high walls of the building are all unstoppable. After several elements are combined together, it’s hard not to let people want to be a demon king who conquers the world. It seems that the original intention of the game is to provide players with such experience, which makes boy a become one of the most classic anti hero characters in the history of the game. It is worth mentioning that Manhattan, the game map of the first generation of sadism, was the material of a cancelled spider man game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The application and performance of Parkour in the game, like the flow of water/cd7d35422949479aad5e823dc8eea9ef.jpg" alt="The application and performance of Parkour in the game, like the flow of water"><br>In that world, who doesn’t want to be an omnipotent villain?<br> concluding remarks<br>Of course, there are a lot of Parkour elements in the game or the game with Parkour as the core method of play. I will not go over them here. I hope you can turn off your computer and do more sports, or try the real Parkour. What we need to remember is that parkour, though handsome, is still dangerous. Even if we are proficient in the action, we should not try too dangerous obstacles at will.</li>

    <title>The birth of waste land game is it the world you yearn for without the restriction of morality and law</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/The%20birth%20of%20waste%20land%20game%20is%20it%20the%20world%20you%20yearn%20for%20without%20the%20restriction%20of%20morality%20and%20law/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In any field, there is always a question: if one day the world is destroyed and you survive, what will you do? There are different answers to this topic, but one thing we can be sure of:   no one knows how the world will be destroyed, after all, no one has ever lived in the end. For a long time, works related to eschatology have been active in various fields. It is precisely because of the unknown of eschatology that many works related to eschatology have been derived.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The birth of waste land game is it the world you yearn for without the restriction of morality and law/4c2058e0e6b544c3bb5d6856b312a0c8.jpg" alt="The birth of waste land game is it the world you yearn for without the restriction of morality and law"><br>It’s hard not to think of the “wasteland” when it comes to the “end of the world”. In the film and television industry, we have “2012” and “the day after tomorrow”, which are not masterpieces, but are called classic films. In the field of video games, there are more works that can be called names. For a long time, these self-contained works have naturally derived a new cultural category, which is called “waste land culture”.<br>The waste soil culture has been continuously improved over time. Although the waste soil culture can be said to be the most understandable and clear one among all kinds of cultural categories in the shaping of world outlook, a common concept has not been jumped out from the beginning to the end: Although the waste soil is cool, no one would expect such a day to come.</p>
<p>There is no fixed definition of waste soil culture. As long as it has experienced natural and man-made disasters and human civilization has disintegrated, it can be called waste soil, and waste soil has also derived a variety of different styles, both retro and future. If the works that can represent the category of “cyberpunk” are the “blade killer” series, the works that can represent the wasteland culture will undoubtedly mention “Mad Max”.<br>Crazy Max was born in 1979. Director George Miller never made any film before shooting crazy max. he won the best director award of Australian Film Academy with this film. At first, no one was very optimistic about the film, because its description of violence and sex was not taboo, too straightforward, and was criticized by people from all walks of life. What’s funny is that as a “rotten film”, it is well-known, its reputation is great, and there will be more people who naturally pay attention to it, and it’s just because there are so many people watching it that its depth and internal are mined by the media and the masses Come out.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The birth of waste land game is it the world you yearn for without the restriction of morality and law/75e1d3507dd546afaff02f18ef4919cf.jpg" alt="The birth of waste land game is it the world you yearn for without the restriction of morality and law"><br>The man’s classic black leather coat with dog shape is available in many games and movies<br>Mad Max of the early generation is not a pure wasteland movie, but more like a police and bandit movie. The main background time of the movie is placed in the bleak near future. The civilized society is still alive but crumbling, though not wasteland, it is almost wasteland. And from the beginning of the sequel, the world view of the film is gradually starting to unfold, becoming a world full of diesel and gunpowder. In the cost limit, the film production is relatively rough, but the director has turned this into his own advantage. After all, there were not many realistic style works of video games at that time, and later works paid too much attention to the special effects production of the film, while the ordinary and unadorned Mad Max became the most eye-catching one, in which the wearing of the protagonist, the various designs in the waste soil Will also lay a large foundation for related works.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The birth of waste land game is it the world you yearn for without the restriction of morality and law/785bcb3b9f42412fb5ab102d129c4e98.jpg" alt="The birth of waste land game is it the world you yearn for without the restriction of morality and law"><br>So that it has launched its own adaptation game of the same name</p>
<p>#From waste soil to radiation<br>In 1988, interplay produced an RPG game called wasteland, which was released by EA company. The emergence of “wasteland” broke the stereotyped theme of “sword and magic” in RPG game in the game market. The background of “wasteland” was set in the west of the United States after the nuclear war. As mentioned above, human civilization in the game was almost extinct, without legal and moral constraints, and everywhere was burning, looting and looting In order to prevent these villains from doing evil, some people spontaneously stand up and express their willingness to repair all these things. They set up a team that has been specially dealing with these groups. Its name is “desert Ranger”. The main role of the player is the leader of the desert Ranger, who manages waste land and water fires.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The birth of waste land game is it the world you yearn for without the restriction of morality and law/e23e46194ed749409227a09b7ea2f435.jpg" alt="The birth of waste land game is it the world you yearn for without the restriction of morality and law"><br>The first generation of “waste soil” has been reprinted in high definition<br>The highlight of the game is that players can explore in this wasteland at will and get involved in various events. There are no black or white forces and organizations in the whole world, and the choices made by players are often in the gray area between them. The super freedom and rich content of the game are bound to prove that this is not a bad game. The game won numerous awards, and also won the best RPG award of the year.<br>After the success of the game, it is natural to launch a sequel to maintain the popularity of the game, but it is helpless that the copyright of the game is in EA’s hands, so interplay decided to be its own publisher to launch a spiritual sequel for the waste land series, and this game is the world-famous RPG work fallout. Later, the series of “waste soil” was developed by crowdfunding, and “waste soil 3” at this year’s E3 exhibition finally indicated that it would be released next spring.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The birth of waste land game is it the world you yearn for without the restriction of morality and law/d0572bf40b254e5e920f17785a28d0fe.jpg" alt="The birth of waste land game is it the world you yearn for without the restriction of morality and law"><br>The style of radiation is slightly different from that of waste land, but the background is also after the nuclear war. Radiation adopts a very unique retro science fiction style and is full of black humor. Although radiation is not so depressing in the overall atmosphere, it is not easy to go anywhere. On the contrary, the addition of black humor elements makes every plot in the game more hairy Bone is terrified. No matter the setting, the system or the style, radiation perfectly explains what is called “single tree and one grid”. It is from then on that time that a variety of other “wasteland” works began to appear on the market. So far, four orthodox works and one kind of derivative and external works have been launched by the palace of radiation series, which has become the synonym of “waste land game” in the game circle.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The birth of waste land game is it the world you yearn for without the restriction of morality and law/c250b7cc4cf344de9e50c86ce1b30ef7.jpg" alt="The birth of waste land game is it the world you yearn for without the restriction of morality and law"><br>The more new you make, the better radiation: New Vegas is</p>
<h1 id="tail-Thinking"><a href="#tail-Thinking" class="headerlink" title="tail: Thinking"></a>tail: Thinking</h1><p>After radiation, we can also see such realistic style game works as sneaker and subway. They all like to put the background of the game behind the nuclear war, from which we can find the intention: the producer hopes to greatly improve the sense of substitution of the players through a relatively realistic background. Since the realistic style of walking can never say that the earth is out of the world Starmen attacked this science fiction setting.<br>In these works, players usually face a variety of choices. For example, if you save someone, this person will give you money, but obviously this person needs more money than you do. Do you want to collect or not? There are many nuclear war shelters in radiation. On the surface, these shelters are for the purpose of accepting refugees. In fact, all the shelters are secretly carrying out various experiments on human beings. Most of the time, these experiments will make people become turtles in a jar and suffer from the treatment of life is not like death.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The birth of waste land game is it the world you yearn for without the restriction of morality and law/5ffcf8a958af48a49040957c497cdfb4.jpg" alt="The birth of waste land game is it the world you yearn for without the restriction of morality and law"><br>Although no one has experienced the cruelty of waste land, we can only experience it in the virtual world through games, but the plots described in these games are not impossible to happen.

From another perspective, the game All the plots in are to express people’s fear of war and thinking about human nature.<br>In the final analysis, although the waste soil culture is very attractive, including the author’s love, but waste soil is not a yearning existence. If there is such a day, even how to play “prevention needle”, it will waver in the face of choice. Some people do not know how many people are looking forward to the end of the world, and feel that they can show their skills at that time When all suffering is defeated in front of you, you will regret your ignorance more and more.</p>

    <title>The concept of frames and pictures will affect the game experience started from this racing game of the last century</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/The%20concept%20of%20frames%20and%20pictures%20will%20affect%20the%20game%20experience%20started%20from%20this%20racing%20game%20of%20the%20last%20century/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Nowadays, almost all mainstream game works adopt 3D game pictures, which are very smooth and comfortable to play. This is not a strange thing at present. After all, with the development of video games, players’ cognition of the game is much higher than before. Everyone knows that the low frame number (too violent fluctuation) of the game will make the game perform badly In order to solve this problem, most players have been able to understand the meaning of video options in the game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The concept of frames and pictures will affect the game experience started from this racing game of the last century/271847270a0e42d9b62e413efa3d6452.jpg" alt="The concept of frames and pictures will affect the game experience started from this racing game of the last century"><br>We can have today’s game experience without the research and improvement of development technology by game manufacturers. In the early years, games were 2D pixel mosaics, but in fact, due to technical limitations, although the concept of 3D games appeared early, it has not been well developed. The early 3D games not only had rough pictures and low fluency, but also had to play all the functions of the hardware at that time to run reluctantly. At one time, people thought that 3D games were nothing more than that. Until the emergence of a arcade racing game called sleepwalking America, it really subverted people’s cognition and set a benchmark for subsequent works.</p>
<h1 id="Full-3D"><a href="#Full-3D" class="headerlink" title="Full 3D"></a>Full 3D</h1><p>In the early years, most developers didn’t have a clear understanding of the real 3D games. They believed that players only need to feel the “three-dimensional sense” from the game screen when playing, which can be called 3D. Freehand drawing a cube on a plane is the simplest 3D image. The original 3D is to bring this concept into the game to design 3D game images, rather than using 3D modeling as is now common. There was a “3D fever” in the game circle for a while. Many games like to add a 3D after the title of the game (now it is mostly seen in hand games). At that time, a variety of so-called “3D games” appeared. Although some games are difficult to be called “true 3D”, although the performance is amazing, it is difficult to be satisfied with the performance of fluency.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The concept of frames and pictures will affect the game experience started from this racing game of the last century/f26b6fe06744434a8d223c804fe454b6.jpg" alt="The concept of frames and pictures will affect the game experience started from this racing game of the last century"><br>“Sonic 3D Big Bang” named 3D but without 3D content<br>In the 1980s, Japan’s Sega company was flourishing in the field of arcade games. Their arcade represents the highest game development technology and the best human-computer interaction experience at that time. These skills are closely related to a person named Suzuki Yu. Under the leadership of Ling Muyu, Sega’s AM2 research and development department took the lead in exploring high frame rate 3D games. Many driving games developed by him, such as hang on and outrun, have very fast game rhythm and smooth picture expression. They use 2D layers to zoom and overlay to show the effect of “Pseudo 3D”, but the Pseudo 3D is still Pseudo 3D after all, which is not a small distance from the real game image modeled by full 3D Saturn.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The concept of frames and pictures will affect the game experience started from this racing game of the last century/79c38d309a94486bb74426128ecb36a4.jpg" alt="The concept of frames and pictures will affect the game experience started from this racing game of the last century"><br>Outrun, one of the greatest racing games<br>In 1992, AM2 launched the 3D racing game “VR racing car” based on the original model arcade version. At this time, they are trying to create a real full 3D screen game by themselves. Before that, nanmenggong has launched “winning run” as the first full 3D racing game in history, and the screen performance of “VR racing car” is undoubtedly better than the former. It is worth mentioning that the vehicle and map of the game are modeled by full 3D polygons, while only the sky and background of the game are 2D images, while the fluency of the background can reach 60 frames. Although the performance of the game has been excellent, there is still a gap from their ideal performance. Their next step is to improve the quality of the image and the number of frames at the same time.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The concept of frames and pictures will affect the game experience started from this racing game of the last century/e615c693e3be40e0af7aaf3e05e1b6f8.jpg" alt="The concept of frames and pictures will affect the game experience started from this racing game of the last century"><br>VR racing (the picture is the NS transplant version, but the picture is the same as the original version)</p>
<h1 id="Daytona"><a href="#Daytona" class="headerlink" title="Daytona"></a>Daytona</h1><p>With Suzuki Yu to study high frame rate 3D games, there is another famous gamer named Yue Nianyang. He participated in the development of VR racing. Two years after VR racing went public, mingyuenianyang got the chance to develop a game as a producer, and his work is the benchmark level Daytona USA. In two years, SEGA and AM2 have developed the second generation of model arcade, which is several times more powerful than the previous one, so it can also provide better picture performance. This arcade is a joint production of SEGA and an aerospace company, and the latter provides Sega with their system for 3D graphics operation, so the model can have such powerful performance parameters.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The concept of frames and pictures will affect the game experience started from this racing game of the last century/d13603f83bb24e44970b1a2da3b0a223.jpg" alt="The concept of frames and pictures will affect the game experience started from this racing game of the last century"><br>Original arcade screen<br>There is a very popular race in the United States called NASCAR racing. People who have a little knowledge of car culture will probably know that the core point of this race is the “wrestling war” between cars. Compared with the general professional race, NASCAR is more rough and passionate. NASCAR organizes more than 2000 Games every year, taking March as the beginning of a new season. The first game of each season, “Daytona 500” is the most important and greatest game in NASCAR’s history. Not to mention how the name of “sleepwalking America” came from, but it can be sure that this game is based on this event, And the primary difficulty track in the game is based on the well-known detona international track as the prototype.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The concept of frames and pictures will affect the game experience started from this racing game of the last century/2a556c29f6de47a7a499ee4a72437a8c.jpg" alt="The concept of frames and pictures will affect the game experience started from this racing game of the last century"><br>Nasca’s style is full of smoke<br>Back to the game, “dream back to America” is the first game developed by using the model 2 arcade, which can only be described as “unprecedented” in the picture performance. If the picture in the game is put in the present view, although it is old, it is difficult to appear the idea of “ugly”. Dream back to America is the first 3D game to use “material filtering (also called texture filtering)” technology, which reduces the graininess and sharp edge of the map in the game, making the material of the game look very smooth and soft. For example, its visual perception is very close to the highest quality “anti terrorist elite 1.6”, although this system follows in the game now It can be seen here, but at that time, it was the only one in Sega.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The concept of frames and pictures will affect the game experience started from this racing game of the last century/bb4fa4c4293b4938bb5d94d717ecd042.jpg" alt="The concept of frames and pictures will affect the game experience started from this racing game of the last century"><br>Simple comparison with and without material filtering (no filtering material on the left)<br>The key point is that sleepwalk America is the first full 3D game that can reach 60 frames, and nothing is more important than the processing speed for a racing game. If the scene refresh rate of the map can’t keep up with the high-speed driving of the players, it will be easy to make a play error, but there has never been such a problem in sleepwalk America. Later, Sega also transplanted sleepwalk America to various home computer platforms, and even launched exclusive versions for PCs, but the sales volume is still not very ideal, because for the players at that time, only this arcade version of sleepwalk America had the best and best experience in 3D games.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The concept of frames and pictures will affect the game experience started from this racing game of the last century/57c9f991cc8f4d50af195db34217b061.jpg" alt="The concept of frames and pictures will affect the game experience started from this racing game of the last century"><br>High definition transplant version of PS3 host in 2011<br>End of<br>It’s difficult to compare the performance of model 2 with that of the home computer in the same period. If the transplanted version of “sleepwalking America” is either too poor in picture or too low in frame number, it’s hard to get the same game experience as the arcade version, although it’s the same game content as the arcade version. It is also these general versions of home computers that make players realize for the first time the importance of pictures and frames for the game experience, and pay more attention to the hardware performance of the platform.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The concept of frames and pictures will affect the game experience started from this racing game of the last century/d7f96408e4044c2f824a10cd5acf518f.jpg" alt="The concept of frames and pictures will affect the game experience started from this racing game of the last century"><br>“Sleepwalking America: Championship” has made great progress, but it is basically the same as this generation<br>As for the arcade version of sleepwalking America, there have been four works launched on the arcade platform so far, and the second and third generations are separated by 18 years. Now, the latest work sleepwalking America: Championship supports eight people to fight online at the same time, which is really a party game for family. During this period, although Sega did not forget the work that made countless brilliant achievements for him, it was more just to put it on more platforms to let more players experience it. As for those players who are used to playing top 3A works, whether they can accept this very old game picture depends on whether they can accept the contrast between hamburger and egg hamburger.</p>

    <title>The forerunner abandoned by the times, why is it hard to see the arena FPS on the market</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>In today’s video games and fields, first person shooting games have long been a common category of games. Almost every other short period of time, large factories and small factories from all over the world have launched works of different styles. At present, FPS games are more popular in competitive games and have their own one acre and three points. Although they may not be as hot as all kinds of MoBa games, they win In a variety of styles, but also in the field of competitive games occupy a large share.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The forerunner abandoned by the times, why is it hard to see the arena FPS on the market/58ee7a16ccda430693b7b5b57cc83f72.jpg" alt="The forerunner abandoned by the times, why is it hard to see the arena FPS on the market"><br>At present, FPS has many different types. They have different playing methods and rhythms. There are tactical shooting types that emphasize the randomness of tactical collocation, and there are also classical types that shoot and explode everything with a big weapon. However, it’s not surprising that there is such a type that many people may have contact with him, and there are many people who have heard the representative works under this type, but in today’s game market, this kind of game works are almost on the brink of extinction. Do you remember where the word “rocket jump” came from? Do you know what kind of game made that “German boy” smash the keyboard? It’s called the arena FPS, or AFP for short.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The forerunner abandoned by the times, why is it hard to see the arena FPS on the market/7bef36a8084d46d6a839b8e063416dac.jpg" alt="The forerunner abandoned by the times, why is it hard to see the arena FPS on the market"></p>
<h1 id="pioneers"><a href="#pioneers" class="headerlink" title="pioneers"></a>pioneers</h1><p>Before the birth of G Pang’s half life, most FPS games on the market basically had no plot. At that time, doom, led by id software, was the leader in the whole FPS game field. In the view of the players at that time, as a “cool is done” shooting game, the plot really didn’t care much about anything. What the players need to do in doom is to control the protagonist to explore in the map and find the way out of each map. Just point your weapons at the monsters and enemies on the way and pull the trigger. Basically, everything that will appear in front of you and move will pose a threat to you. A major feature of this series is that the protagonist does not need to load bullets for the weapons in his hands, but different weapons need different types of ammunition. Only if there is ammunition in reserve, you can finish it all at once. Because the action is the short board of this work, producer John Romero shot part of the gap (though horizontal) that can be crossed by using rocket launchers in the map, which is the origin of “rocket jumping”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The forerunner abandoned by the times, why is it hard to see the arena FPS on the market/337d3aa60e6945fdae9016b3835a9f16.jpg" alt="The forerunner abandoned by the times, why is it hard to see the arena FPS on the market"><br>1993 the destroyer<br>The more kinds of weapons the protagonist can get, the more complex they will be in the later stage. At first, there are pistols, shotguns, chainsaws and so on. At the later stage, they can get Gatling, rocket launchers and BFG, which can clear the screen. They can let the players immerse themselves in the fancy killing of the enemy. In short, the core of the game is to let the players through the smart movement and the characteristics of using each weapon flexibly, just need to find a way to wipe out the enemy, and from the beginning of the works, the game supports multi player online battle, playing method and single machine mode have been completely all the time, but the enemy of the player is also the player, and it is precisely because of this, these characteristics can be achieved in the player’s To the greatest extent. In doom, players will fight in a closed map. Although the action composition is not high, they can also try to play some small tactics, such as squatting beside the weapon or walking around the path quickly. This is the origin of the type of AFP game. Several players fight with each other in a closed arena, so it is named arena FPS.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The forerunner abandoned by the times, why is it hard to see the arena FPS on the market/202b6e71ac09411ea579d4dc83c3bcc6.jpg" alt="The forerunner abandoned by the times, why is it hard to see the arena FPS on the market"><br>BFG</p>
<h1 id="forerunner"><a href="#forerunner" class="headerlink" title="forerunner"></a>forerunner</h1><p>In 1998, id software launched a new FPS “quake” with real 3D screen, playing the same way as “doom”, and the biggest change compared with “doom” is that the main character added jumping in the game, but just adding a jump can make the core digging method of the play more possible. This work also supports many people to fight, better picture and better operation feel, which makes this work quickly replace the scenery of doom. At the same time, this work has a very high open source, which allows players to participate in the modification of the game and make new content. Therefore, some players start to make other game modes in this work, the most popular and influential mode is to seize Capture the flag, the player needs to grab the flag of the other team from the map and bring back the score of our camp to get the score. At the same time, we must organize the local members to take away our flag. It is a bit like adding a sport to FPS. This mode has been circulating so far, and has evolved into a variety of versions, which will appear in most confrontational FPS games.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The forerunner abandoned by the times, why is it hard to see the arena FPS on the market/5958c0733e094f3db9004a03c4096a8b.jpg" alt="The forerunner abandoned by the times, why is it hard to see the arena FPS on the market"><br>1996 hammer of thunderbolt<br>The hammer of thunder series has launched many works subsequently, and each of them is constantly updated and improved. The multiplayer mode of the series is also more perfect than the other. By the time of three generations, it is more direct to make a pure multiplayer game, which is enough to see that id software attaches great importance to the multiplayer mode of the series, and the influence of this series is also constantly improving. The popularity of “hammer of thunderbolt” has made other manufacturers see red eyes. They want to share a share in the same way. If they want to defeat the king, they must first obtain the same strength as the king. But it is undoubtedly the simplest way to directly refer to the mode of “hammer of thunderbolt”. With this thinking, epic game, the developer of the unreal engine, launched the series of “unreal arena” and “Thunderbolt” Hammer 3 was released only ten days later.<br>Virtual arena was developed with the help of digital extremes, a Canadian studio. Most of the weapons were designed by them. Thanks to the integration of game modes, the novelty design of weapons and the openness of maps, this “integrated” work soon caught up with hammer of thunderbolt and became two of the FPS competitive games at that time Big oligarch, let “German boy” gas to hit the keyboard is this work.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The forerunner abandoned by the times, why is it hard to see the arena FPS on the market/adce0a25b0de48c0b529085c95a91924.jpg" alt="The forerunner abandoned by the times, why is it hard to see the arena FPS on the market"><br>1999 unreal Arena</p>
<h1 id="innovator"><a href="#innovator" class="headerlink" title="innovator"></a>innovator</h1><p>Once upon a time, most of the adversary FPS adopted this kind of fast-paced AFPs mode, which focuses on personal skills and technology. Considering that these games usually require quick response and operation of players, but it is not easy for the handle to achieve this effect. In addition, at that time, the design of the host FPS game was not mature, so the AFPs has only been used for a long time Active only on PC platform. Until 2001, halo, a FPS game specially developed by Bungie for the early Xbox, broke this situation. Since 2000, every developer has begun to focus on the host platform, and halo, as a science fiction FPS, contains a multi person mode, which can be said to have quite revolutionary significance. Halo reduces the speed and rhythm of the game, and designs the operation mode of the game’s handle as comfortable as possible. It only retains the mode in the traditional APFs, but it is closer to a modern FPs in playing method. It not only makes it possible for the host to play competitive FPS, but also allows more people to have the opportunity to join the camp.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The forerunner abandoned by the times, why is it hard to see the arena FPS on the market/951a9b7521e141bf966b3d30c4612a63.jpg" alt="The forerunner abandoned by the times, why is it hard to see the arena FPS on the market"><br>2001 halo<br>Halo brings new inspiration to the whole game industry. After all, the mainframe is a big fat meat. Whoever grabs it first will enjoy it first. He redefined the FPS of the mainframe, so the FPS on the market began to move closer to halo, including the later emergence of battlefield and call of Duty series. In addition to several FPS focusing on competition, the online content will be basically The rhythm has dropped. Of course, the traditional AFP, which is both painstaking and laborious, is no longer favored. So the game category just disappeared? In fact, the above two oligarchs are also persisting in launching new works later. However, for game developers, these works are no longer popular, so they are only for a small number of players to make, and they don’t need to make in a big way. In short, they have shifted the focus of development.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The forerunner abandoned by the times, why is it hard to see the arena FPS on the market/1c4761f8c6a44b44815ebbbdb8e0774f.jpg" alt="The forerunner abandoned by the times, why is it hard to see the arena FPS on the market"><br>2013 battlefield 4</p>
<h1 id="losers"><a href="#losers" class="headerlink" title="losers"></a>losers</h1><p>In 2014, epic announced the development of a new “virtual arena” work. This work was originally planned to be led by a 20 person team of epic, encouraging community players to participate in the game development together, and will adopt the materials produced by players in the future. With the popularity of the big escape game later, epic joined a big escape mode in his own failed work “night of the fortress”. Unexpectedly, it suddenly caught fire, so he simply ordered all the staff of the development department to focus on “night of the fortress”. As for this “unreal arena”, there is no updated dynamic until today, and it still stays in the early development stage According to the official: because most of the original members are already the core development members of Fortress night, and the company is very confused about the future plan of the game, so we can only temporarily put the game development on hold. This situation is just like the previous few years’ work “Paragon”, which also came from epic and died, with a great probability of continuing.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The forerunner abandoned by the times, why is it hard to see the arena FPS on the market/349702a070b44b39934d26df9941a83b.jpg" alt="The forerunner abandoned by the times, why is it hard to see the arena FPS on the market"><br>2014 new unreal Arena<br>As for hammer of thunderbolt on the other side, after id software was acquired by Bethesda, the IP was temporarily put on hold for a period of time. During this period, ID participated in the development of rage, new destroyer, German headquarters and other works, and supported the classical FPS market with its own strength, making it rejuvenate. As for hammer of thunderbolt, ID launched a sub era version called hammer of thunderbolt: champion in 2017, and the mode and playing method of the game itself have been greatly reformed, adopting the role division settings like “watch the pioneer” and “Legion Fortress 2”. Even the official said that the game was pushed to match the watch the pioneer series However, the old players who have been waiting for the new work are annoyed by doing so. After all, the game that starts with two hands and equipment depends on picking up is a series of tradition, adding the character system will undoubtedly lose its original flavor. In the same way, the development focus of community B and ID has basically shifted to the very successful “destroyer” in recent years. There is no one to take care of the quality of this free game. Today, more than two years later, this game is still in the “preemptive experience” stage.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The forerunner abandoned by the times, why is it hard to see the arena FPS on the market/9e4a1e0a26e6499087994aab35813575.jpg" alt="The forerunner abandoned by the times, why is it hard to see the arena FPS on the market"><br>Hammer of thunderbolt: Champion 2017<br>    concluding remarks<br>The decline of AFP games is largely related to the changes of the times, but it is undeniable that although their competitors are very strong, the developers take profit as the first goal and do not pay attention to this dying game type, which also accounts for a lot of responsibility. Maybe a lot of players grew up playing CS, and a lot of people came here playing hammer of thunder and unreal arena. In the latter’s view, maybe these works not only have a strong appreciation, but also a fast-paced game environment is very suitable for long-term operation. The last round may be about the same time as a “landing into a box” Between. It’s a pity that the glorious deeds of this great “forerunner” are so forgotten. I hope that these two oligarchs will get their “second life” one day. After all, there are many people who want to ask for an acceptable statement.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>In recent times, the most artistic game, of course, is “death stranded” by Hideki Oshima. Players who know Hideki Oshima may know that Hideki is a serious movie lover. He has always wanted to shoot a formal video film of his own, but because of his identity as a gamer, he has not been able to realize this dream, but as an art game The comprehensive product of art form is a good substitute, so the vast majority of the island’s games like to use the form of expression similar to the film, and “stranded in death” is probably the closest game work in the style of the film in the history of the island.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The gap between film and game has been broken, but the best partner has not yet been formed/7655c089bd36417aad30ea6e0f28db6a.jpg" alt="The gap between film and game has been broken, but the best partner has not yet been formed"><br>In the early years, games and movies were always two unrelated forms of entertainment. However, with the continuous development of science and technology, the production quality of video games did not agree with the past. From the original pure entertainment products to today’s “ninth art”, which means that the distance between games and other art forms is shrinking, and the distance between games and movies is also shrinking. Some people want to make games into movies, while others want to make movies into games. At present, there are not a few such products, but they have never formed a complete combination of the two fields, and their final works will always tend to one of them.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The gap between film and game has been broken, but the best partner has not yet been formed/f811b038ef9c465ca4e8573ba50e3518.jpg" alt="The gap between film and game has been broken, but the best partner has not yet been formed"></p>
<h1 id="film-Gamification"><a href="#film-Gamification" class="headerlink" title="film Gamification"></a>film Gamification</h1><p>In the early years, the main game market focused on the home console and the arcade, in which the development speed of the home console may be a little faster than the arcade game. There was a “pixel war” in the golden age of home console games. Various manufacturers scrambled to upgrade their hardware specifications first. The 8bit screen seemed to be upgraded to 32bit screen in a flash, and the better the screen, the greater the capacity of the game. Therefore, it is difficult for the traditional cassette to load these games, and the CD-ROM has become the mainstream game to replace the cassette Medium of play.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The gap between film and game has been broken, but the best partner has not yet been formed/d42530d99a3442e69d93cbcaa26a05c9.jpg" alt="The gap between film and game has been broken, but the best partner has not yet been formed"><br>Sega MD and Sega CD (Sega CD is an external device and cannot be used alone)<br>At that time, several home computers like to add a “CD” after the name of the host and the game to be used as a publicity gimmick, and it is at this time that the first video game “Dragon Cave Adventure” produced by FMV appeared.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The gap between film and game has been broken, but the best partner has not yet been formed/813122ee55b44a28bd521c7d28214250.jpg" alt="The gap between film and game has been broken, but the best partner has not yet been formed"><br>The whole animation performance of “the adventures of Dragon Cave”<br>The so-called full motion video game refers to the game made by combining the video or animation clips recorded by real people, while “Adventures of Dragon Cave” is made by former Disney animator don Bruce, who is like making animation frame by frame. At first, the game was released on the arcade platform, and then transplanted to Sega CD and Amiga computer perfectly, although it seems to be made 10 times The game experience of players is like watching a Disney animation, but it’s actually just a simple QTE game, which needs to help the protagonist avoid some attacks and obstacles. Although it seems that the production of this kind of game is time-consuming, laborious and expensive, in fact, it is much cheaper and easier than the previous game production. The animation drawing is basically the same process as the general animation production, while the real-life performance only requires a few actors to record several videos according to the requirements, and the final effect is also unsatisfactory, which is the initial “film / Animation The concept of “play”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The gap between film and game has been broken, but the best partner has not yet been formed/ce379c7c1b39499a95dc5e42fca0a425.jpg" alt="The gap between film and game has been broken, but the best partner has not yet been formed"><br>The infamous classic midnight trap (photo is a replica of the 25th anniversary)<br>Regardless of the theme and form of expression, the core selling point of these works is always the plot, and whether the production level is excellent or not is only used to better present the works. Then there appeared a more sophisticated form of expression, collectively referred to as “interactive films”. For example, in recent years, the very popular “Detroit: changing people” or “invisible Guardian” can be called interactive films. On the surface, they are games, but in fact, regardless of the nature of the phenomenon, they are actually the same concept as the early “Adventures of Dragon Cave” , but the picture and fineness should be better.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The gap between film and game has been broken, but the best partner has not yet been formed/80384a3efa974d949f0147dc27ce5917.jpg" alt="The gap between film and game has been broken, but the best partner has not yet been formed"><br>3A interactive film Detroit: changing people<br>Take Detroit: changing people as an example. If the perfect ending of the game is taken as the end of the story and all other branch options are left aside, then it is just a 3D movie that tells the conflicts and disputes between people and bionic people. It has all the design and ideas that a movie should have. It just makes the story interactive after joining the option branch. This is also the point of developers They know it well, so they don’t call their works “games”. As for the popular interactive video, it is the same idea, but the latter is less difficult and cheaper to produce, but it also takes a lot of time to polish if you want to create excellent works.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The gap between film and game has been broken, but the best partner has not yet been formed/f5891321bf0d40d6b57f18de69cfbbf4.jpg" alt="The gap between film and game has been broken, but the best partner has not yet been formed"><br>Netflix’s interactive drama “black mirror: pandasinaki”</p>
<h1 id="cinematization-of-games"><a href="#cinematization-of-games" class="headerlink" title="cinematization of games"></a>cinematization of games</h1><p>In short, the so-called movie Gamification refers to the introduction of interactive system in the movie, which can give the player short-term operation power or make the player make a choice for the direction of the story, but its essence is still the plot as the main body, while the so-called “game Filmization” is just the opposite, its essence is always the game, but it has incorporated some movie design ideas. Exactly speaking, this kind of design idea will not affect the design concept of the game itself. At best, it will affect the game’s form of expression and narrative techniques, so as to provide better game experience for the players. At the beginning of the article, I mentioned that most of the works of Xiufu Oshima adopted the design idea of film, and it seems that he was the first person who dared to try this form.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The gap between film and game has been broken, but the best partner has not yet been formed/85ff2b8dcc19475b98964d7c186afe68.jpg" alt="The gap between film and game has been broken, but the best partner has not yet been formed"><br>Although the island pursues literature and art excessively, it has good taste<br>After entering the 3D era of PS host, alloy equipment, a tactical espionage game made by Xiaodao Xiufu, uses a large number of real-time calculation and script animation forms in the game, which makes the plot performance effect of the game very vivid and has a sense of substitution, and has the feeling of movie in the experience. People who have played this series know that the plot of the game itself is excellent, and the performance effect is eye-catching, but the core of the game is still the stealth of tactical espionage, as for the cinematic performance form, it just plays a finishing point for the game itself.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The gap between film and game has been broken, but the best partner has not yet been formed/fc11a028367540af8c5b7bd251a9e99b.jpg" alt="The gap between film and game has been broken, but the best partner has not yet been formed"><br>Tactical espionage game alloy equipment solide<br>Then, the effect of script performance and real-time calculation began to be popular in the development industry, and with the improvement of game development technology, these techniques can create better effects in a better picture, of which the most well-known is FPS game “call of duty” series. Since the beginning of the series, “call of duty” has created a performance comparable to “Saving Private Ryan” by referring to a large number of war films, and then in the “modern war” series, it has created a script performance with great visual impact by using the characteristics of the first person perspective, just like the classic bridge in the film, which has created an irreplaceable one for the players Classic bridge sections.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The gap between film and game has been broken, but the best partner has not yet been formed/bd46ac24d8e14493b8d41cc89256b5c2.jpg" alt="The gap between film and game has been broken, but the best partner has not yet been formed"><br>How many people don’t recognize the scene<br>In any case, most of the films are in the form of linear process, so it is undoubtedly the best choice to use in linear games, and the above-mentioned classic works are always based on linear games, and the current leader in this field is Sony’s Naughty Dog Studio. Naughty dog’s “mysterious sea area” series and “the last survivor” have adopted a lot of cinematic narrative techniques, and have a very good experience in the design of the lens and plot rhythm, rather than Xiaodao’s obsession with “one mirror to the end”. These two series not only hold the ups and downs of the plot and rhythm properly in the passage and the whole process, but also you can feel the rhythm of “Relaxation” in similar action movies at each level of each chapter, from gentle to rapid to intense and finally relaxed. The game is full of such a bridge to control the player’s situation Xu, now put the player’s game experience in the first place, and then in the design of pictures and music, there is no cutting corners, which is actually a collection of cinematic games.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The gap between film and game has been broken, but the best partner has not yet been formed/f26aadaf618b40b0b0be20a214815d2c.jpg" alt="The gap between film and game has been broken, but the best partner has not yet been formed"><br>Almost every player will take a deep breath and sigh when playing here, and turn on the camera mode<br>    concluding remarks<br>To sum up, even though the two fields have different forms of interaction and combination, their own essence has never jumped out of the core, the game is always the game, and the movie is always the movie, even if there are different experiences and interaction ways, this is always the same. For developers, whether it’s cinematic games or game movies, no one can be sure whether this is their complete body. Although the two have been organically combined in various forms, it seems that the cross-border development of the two has not stopped, and some people are still trying to find new possibilities. For example, the newly released “stranded in death” has re integrated more movie elements on the basis of the original cinematic narrative, as well as the role of a live all-star cast in the game. In the eyes of the uninformed outsiders, it may really regard “stranded in death” as a movie. This is undoubtedly a new beginning. Maybe we can see their “best match” in our lifetime.</p>

    <title>The legend of ljn, a game company, which is rich in junk games</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/The%20legend%20of%20ljn,%20a%20game%20company,%20which%20is%20rich%20in%20junk%20games/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Ask, what kind of game can be called “bad game”?<br>Maybe they have a very bad operation, maybe they have annoying bugs, maybe they have harsh sound effects, or they don’t play like a game at all, or they seem normal but actually make a mess. Bad games can bring poor game experience to the players, but I believe that no matter which company is willing to make a very bad game, after all, the meal is just right, even the first-line large factories will occasionally make a cold work with poor performance, but I think they are not allowed to do it.<br>But you know that there is a game company, 99% of all the games he has done in his life are bad games. Although the company is no longer there, you have to admit that it is also a kind of ability to do bad games for a lifetime from a certain point of view, and the company, ljn.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The legend of ljn, a game company, which is rich in junk games/4c6cdae5d1dc4c2fb8b67e1f5211768e.jpg" alt="The legend of ljn, a game company, which is rich in junk games"><br>If you know James, a famous presenter of a 404 website in foreign countries, you will not be unfamiliar with the name ljn. In the show of jet God, the game released by ljn is not rare to appear in the program, and most of the time, ljn will be completely sprayed. Because of its bright logo, ljn is also called “death” by the audience and players Death of rainbow, garbage lady and so on. But one thing rarely mentioned in the show is that ljn’s main business is not video games, but toy industry.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The legend of ljn, a game company, which is rich in junk games/fc96d8c9d76845139e48f7c45835b437.jpg" alt="The legend of ljn, a game company, which is rich in junk games"><br>For Gushen, the name ljn is synonymous with bad games</p>
<p>#Toy factory ljn<br>Jack Friedman is a single parent boy. He was born in Queens, New York in the late 1930s. He loved all kinds of toys since he was a child. At that time, the popular Yo Yo and small metal model car were his favorite. In view of his love for toys, he aspires to be engaged in the toy industry when he grows up, and takes this dream as his lifelong goal.<br>Jack has witnessed the beginning and end of the Second World War in his life. As we all know, after the Second World War, the economic situation of the United States has continued to rise. According to the provisions of the then American veterans act, all veterans can receive a certain degree of knowledge education, and at the same time, they can obtain an unconditional loan for entrepreneurship, so as to promote the whole country All kinds of industries have seen a significant rise, including the toy industry.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The legend of ljn, a game company, which is rich in junk games/7cd993e83ac14590b982a114171682e8.jpg" alt="The legend of ljn, a game company, which is rich in junk games"><br>Yo Yo has been around since BC<br>When Jack was 20 years old, he joined a toy company in New York as a sales representative. Naturally, all the people who worked as a sales representative knew what he was doing. It was not a particularly easy job, but even so, Jack still loved his job because it was connected with toys. After a period of time, after accumulating a lot of social experience, he came up with the idea of starting his own game company. He was serious about his work. Norman J Lewis, his former boss, was willing to provide him with financial support. Jack was very grateful for this, so he reversed the initials of his boss’s name as his company’s name , this is ljn.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The legend of ljn, a game company, which is rich in junk games/ef09b8f7f03c4872a69d5f0e3b557e57.jpg" alt="The legend of ljn, a game company, which is rich in junk games"><br>Jack Friedman<br>Jack is a man with a very advanced vision. He realizes that the combination of toys and pop culture works will surely generate huge business opportunities. So for a long time, ljn only focused on the authorized peripheral toys of other pop culture works, and soon won great success. For a time, ljn became the toy company with the fastest progress in that era.<br>In the 1980s, ljn’s popularity in the industry was beyond our reach, which naturally attracted many companies to take its revenue under our control. MCA, the parent company of global film industry, planned to build a perfect industrial chain between global film industry and ljn. Making movies here, making toys for movies there, can be said to be double happiness.<br>With the rise of the video game industry, ljn is also planning to launch video games at this time. It seems that movie adaptation game is a good plan, so ljn accepted the acquisition of MCA.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The legend of ljn, a game company, which is rich in junk games/bd652b477f844b54b1d3d01fc70476e7.jpg" alt="The legend of ljn, a game company, which is rich in junk games"><br>All the films produced by universal at that time were classic works</p>
<h1 id="“dung-factory”-ljn"><a href="#“dung-factory”-ljn" class="headerlink" title="“dung factory” ljn"></a>“dung factory” ljn</h1><p>For ljn, it’s a good thing to be bought by a famous company at a high price, but Jack, as the founder, is not happy. In his opinion, the company he founded has become the property of others, and he has no complete control right, so he chooses to leave.<br>As he said, Jack’s departure has no impact on the company. Ljn still wants to launch video games. They have successively obtained many movie copyrights from MCA for developing adaptation games, such as Spielberg’s jaws, Robert zemikis’s back to the future series, etc., except for the IP of their own films It also includes many third-party authorized IP games of popular TV series and cartoons at that time.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The legend of ljn, a game company, which is rich in junk games/32079d2e33ac432bbfab8ee060cad5f1.jpg" alt="The legend of ljn, a game company, which is rich in junk games"><br>Jaws ljn’s NES game<br>These games are mainly aimed at the US version of Nintendo’s home console nes. From the program “spray God James”, we can know that these games are basically bad games, which always contain such and such problems, such as many bugs, high repetition of game process and content, confusing operation and play methods, ambiguous settings, etc.<br>However, it is worth mentioning that although ljn has numerous rotten games, there is no work developed independently by ljn, ljn is only the publisher of the game and is responsible for the authorization of IP, while the development work is left to a third-party studio, and there have been famous ones such as rare, who developed 007 golden eye, and Atlus, who developed the goddess reincarnation series Team.<br>The reason why they can’t be seen on the cover or package of the game is that at that time, game developers in the industry basically didn’t have the right to sign their names, which was a very common phenomenon at that time. If you want to get authorization, you have to get the approval of the publisher, which is also why so many games will hide the pictures or names of the producers in the eggs of the game 。<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The legend of ljn, a game company, which is rich in junk games/f37279aa8ac24e05876466b18b90613a.jpg" alt="The legend of ljn, a game company, which is rich in junk games"><br>The yadali 2600 game “adventure” colored egg appeared in the movie “top player” is also born as a result</p>
<h1 id="self-inflicted"><a href="#self-inflicted" class="headerlink" title="self inflicted"></a>self inflicted</h1><p>No matter how bad ljn’s game is, as long as it has the authorization of those famous IPS, it can be sold at that time, and the sales volume is still considerable. So why can’t we see ljn now? Don’t forget that ljn’s main business is still a toy company. Two successive acts of death completely declared ljn’s death.<br>In 1986, ljn launched a series of electric water guns called entertech, which is no surprise, but the appearance of this series of water guns is almost the same as that of the real guy, and the high degree of simulation will naturally lead to some problems that could not exist. Because of the shape of the simulation water gun, children are often shot outside the police. Even many criminals can use these toys to carry out criminal activities. Ljn has also been greatly hit by successive incidents. Many cities have banned the sale of simulation toy guns.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The legend of ljn, a game company, which is rich in junk games/926c34a33d7442c88b3e8aced06c7728.jpg" alt="The legend of ljn, a game company, which is rich in junk games"><br>The model of entertech<br>Ljn really remembers to eat or not to fight. After encountering Waterloo once, it launched an air gun that can shoot color bullets. The difference between this gun and the BB bullet model gun we used to play when we were young is not too much. Anyway, it is a lethal toy. At the same time, its own design also has defects, which once again led to controversy. Almost all color bullet guns sold Ljn lost $35 million as a result of all returns.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The legend of ljn, a game company, which is rich in junk games/df020798b0b54802a268d4782a40ff8b.jpg" alt="The legend of ljn, a game company, which is rich in junk games"><br>The name “gotcha” comes from the action comedy film of the same name<br>Faced with these problems, MCA, the parent company, can’t bear it any more. They don’t want to cause unnecessary trouble for this, so they bite their teeth and sell ljn to acclaim, another company. Acclaim is the developer of the famous fighting game “real quick fight” series. After ljn came, they immediately ordered to stop ljn’s toy department and change it to a pure video game publisher. Later, due to the relaxation of various distribution policies, ljn was immediately absorbed by acclaim.<br>Since then, ljn has disappeared. The last time ljn appeared was in 2000. Ljn released a racing game named “the spirit of speed 1937” to log in to Sega DC host. No one knows why the annexed ljn can release the game alone, but only knows that the quality of the game is still the same, which is called “the worst game in 2000”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The legend of ljn, a game company, which is rich in junk games/70e05b70bf974e03b91ef773dd37704b.jpg" alt="The legend of ljn, a game company, which is rich in junk games"><br>The title of “the worst game of 2000” comes from gamespot, an overseas authoritative media<br>End of<br>Since then, ljn has lost its voice, but it is worth mentioning that Jack, the founder of ljn who chose to leave after ljn was acquired, did not continue to work in the toy industry, but founded another game company. This company is the THQ that we are very familiar with, and has released famous game series such as “the black way saints” and “dark blood”.<br>History is always strikingly similar. After playing a round of games, JACK feels that he is not suitable for the industry. He is also popular with young people. It seems that the toy industry is more suitable for him. So he chose to leave again. After Jack left, THQ immediately ushered in a bankruptcy and reorganization. Jack went back to his old business and founded another company, jakk’s Pacific, which focuses on the toy industry. Now, jakk’s Pacific specializes in developing peripheral toys for Nintendo’s IP and Star Wars series, and has survived so far.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The legend of ljn, a game company, which is rich in junk games/6d746911ead045fe84133616a478ec4a.jpg" alt="The legend of ljn, a game company, which is rich in junk games"><br>Nintendo’s licensed toys from jakk’s Pacific<br>Unfortunately, Jack died in 2010 because of some serious blood disorder. He was 70 years old. He had to admit that he was really a god of management. He devoted his whole life to the toy industry and charity industry. He could make three companies with global weight in his life. This love The spirit of career is really worthy of our respect.</p>

    <title>The call of duty mobile game has become a global blockbuster, not only because of the high popularity of IP</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>Nowadays, the performance of smart phones is always improving, so the production scale of mobile games is gradually becoming large. On the portability and popularity, it has been far away from the handheld, and has become a major mainstream platform that can not be ignored. With more and more first-line game manufacturers joining in, the luxury of mobile game lineup is not the same now. It is no longer a dream to bring famous 3A works and IP to mobile platform. The ability of mobile games to attract gold is obvious to all, and anyone wants to take a share in this “gold mine”. However, the players of mobile games play much more, and their vision and taste are becoming increasingly critical. If the quality of the game is not up to standard or the taste is ugly, they will soon be forgotten by people in such a fierce market.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The call of duty mobile game has become a global blockbuster, not only because of the high popularity of IP/dbe92e4ce5494781bc3fa3258e843558.jpg" alt="The call of duty mobile game has become a global blockbuster, not only because of the high popularity of IP"><br>Some time ago, the most topical and hot topic in the mobile game market was “eating chicken” escape. Every manufacturer spared no effort to seize the market. Today, looking at the global market, the most popular overseas is still the night of Fortress, which is dominated by PC and mobile phones, while in the domestic market, only the completely rectified “peace elite” (the former Jedi survival: stimulate the battlefield) has become the final winner. Looking back to the internal competition between Tencent’s Tianmei studio and photon studio, it seems that from the very beginning, Tianmei studio ‘ We will complete the counter attack with a new flag, and this “big killer” is the world famous FPS game “call of duty” authorized by Activision.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The call of duty mobile game has become a global blockbuster, not only because of the high popularity of IP/e2da7725af6845acbd9d52954b042a5e.jpg" alt="The call of duty mobile game has become a global blockbuster, not only because of the high popularity of IP"><br>    gambling<br>There are not many successful cases for overseas game companies to give IP to Chinese game manufacturers as agents, but almost every successful product has excellent quality and good reputation. Otherwise, it is because of its very innovative design and content, such as final fantasy 14 of Shengqu agent, Blizzard games of Netease agent, which have made great achievements 。 However, the popularity of call of duty does not need the author’s introduction. As a new year’s game, it can achieve sales of tens of millions of levels in the global market every year. This data is really scary. This is not the first time Tencent has launched a cooperation on “call of duty” with Activision. As early as 2012, Tencent joined hands with Activision to launch “call of duty ol” for Chinese players only. Many foreign players have seen it very well. This work is authorized by Activision, developed by raven studio of Activision, and planned and operated by Tencent. At first, this work was a FPS online game of good quality. However, with more and more krypton content added, it affected the balance and profiteering of the operation mode, and the reputation of the game continued to decline. Now, the call of duty ol has become the least despised by fans and passers-by players Gu’s call of duty.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The call of duty mobile game has become a global blockbuster, not only because of the high popularity of IP/b20b0246bb3f47ee9d51d7b236af46c3.jpg" alt="The call of duty mobile game has become a global blockbuster, not only because of the high popularity of IP"><br>It is undoubtedly a gamble with great risk to hand over the most valuable business IP to another company’s agent. Call of duty’s first attempt to enter the Chinese market ended in failure. Since the beginning of mobile games, there have been rumors of “call of duty” coming out of mobile games. Until the end of last year, the “call of duty” mobile game produced by Tencent as agent of Tianmei finally appeared in the field of vision of players. It began to pre register on the day of announcement, and then obtained tens of millions of appointments in the global market in a very short time Quantity. But unfortunately, as a game developed by Chinese people, it started to open appointments to Chinese players two months after the global opening of appointments, and now this game has taken the lead in the overseas market online operation, while Guofu has only launched several limited time tests, the biggest reason is that the version number has not been released, until today there is still no news.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The call of duty mobile game has become a global blockbuster, not only because of the high popularity of IP/458c869a50d74360a537a3a4d08aef90.jpg" alt="The call of duty mobile game has become a global blockbuster, not only because of the high popularity of IP"><br>    misunderstanding<br>Some people may not believe that, just a week after its launch, the international service has achieved over 100 million downloads, far more than any of the previous big escape game overseas players praised it, claiming that the original has a high degree of restoration, and has the flavor of “call of duty” online battle in the fighting style. After seeing that the game has made such outstanding achievements, rob kostiqi, President of Activision, also gave a high appraisal to Tencent, which is responsible for the development and operation of the game, and said that it is a “very great game”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The call of duty mobile game has become a global blockbuster, not only because of the high popularity of IP/11dfb0b2908349659a36dddba2b5805e.jpg" alt="The call of duty mobile game has become a global blockbuster, not only because of the high popularity of IP"><br>This work has designed a completely user-defined operation mode for the fast-paced street battle in the call of duty, which makes the operation very simple and comfortable, and includes team competition, occupying points, blasting and many other highly praised modes. Many classic maps that are enjoyed by old players are also used, and popular characters of all generations are added to the game, so to speak This work has a high degree of completion at the beginning of the launch. In terms of weapons, many popular weapons in the original work have been included, and the consistent free parts refitting of call of Duty series have also been inherited. In the battle, even “breathing back blood” and “sliding shovel shooting” have been retained. It can be said that Tianmei suffered from the loss of reduction degree in the last “all the troops out” because of this time, she has remembered the lesson, and has enough reduction degree Kungfu Online.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The call of duty mobile game has become a global blockbuster, not only because of the high popularity of IP/1697ce54b7e44eec8fdcd7a28e7dd25c.jpg" alt="The call of duty mobile game has become a global blockbuster, not only because of the high popularity of IP"><br>For many domestic players, it seems that the call of Duty series has always been a single player campaign, while the multi player battle is a “bonus” outside the campaign. In fact, the call of Duty series was originally a single FPS game dedicated to creating a sense of war presence. Later, it has been trying and exploring the multi player model to build a high degree of completion The unique multi player model, so that later, the volume of multi player model is much more than that of single player model, and the proportion is far more than that of single player model. Today’s call of duty has been maintaining a sales volume of tens of millions in overseas markets, to a large extent, thanks to its now excellent multi player model. Although the name of “call of duty” is well known in China, there are not many core players who are really interested in the series. The core audience of “call of duty” series is the host players in the overseas market, and the base number of domestic core players may only account for less than one tenth of them, which is why many domestic players can not understand why the series One of the reasons why the multiplayer model is so popular.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The call of duty mobile game has become a global blockbuster, not only because of the high popularity of IP/1b5329b6a2a144ec96768bf09d5266fe.jpg" alt="The call of duty mobile game has become a global blockbuster, not only because of the high popularity of IP"><br>    concluding remarks<br>Regardless of the reputation of Tencent’s call of duty ol, at least there is no doubt that Tencent has delivered a very satisfactory answer to many players this time. The high popularity and high reputation of the game have proved everything. As for whether the popularity of “chicken eating” game can be surpassed in China, we need to wait until the release of the national clothing number to make observation, but at least one thing can be sure is that the quality of this game and the achievements it made at the beginning of its launch are enough to catch up with his “rivals”. However, in the future, whether this work can maintain this level, we have to Cicada.</p>

    <title>The higher the level, the crazier In depth understanding of epic&#39;s past glory and current difficulties</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/The%20higher%20the%20level,%20the%20crazier%20In%20depth%20understanding%20of%20epic&#39;s%20past%20glory%20and%20current%20difficulties/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Throughout the recent game circle, most of the game manufacturers have always maintained a relatively stable performance. Apart from Ubisoft, which was recently reviled by tens of thousands of people due to “ghost action: breakpoint”, I’m afraid that Epic Games, standing on the cusp of the storm, has the worst reputation. People who know this company may know that it is famous for its R &amp; D engine. Later, it became an international first-line game manufacturer again by relying on Fortress night, making a lot of money. Since this company started to sell games, the criticism about this company has not subsided until now. It can be said that it destroyed its own hard to establish Good reputation.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The higher the level, the crazier In depth understanding of epic's past glory and current difficulties/795d32e19c614afdb5c7377c028c5aff.jpg" alt="The higher the level, the crazier In depth understanding of epic&#39;s past glory and current difficulties"><br>But Tucao go to Tucao, it is undeniable that the company is not only rich and powerful, but in some aspects of the platform competition is somewhat persistent and crazy, spare no effort to lose money to think about to pull down Steam, like a new era of “Heroes”. The author holds a reservation on the evaluation of epic. This time, I want to take you to have a deep understanding of all aspects of epic.<br>False and false<br>The author has such a feeling that anyone who talks about the origin of video games can always contact a talented gamer named John kamak and his related achievements, and this is no exception. The first first person shooting game in the history of the game is “German headquarters 3D” created by John kamak. Although this game is not the first game to adopt the first person as the perspective, it is the first game about the concept of “game engine”. In short, he is always thinking about making a 3D game. No matter what type and theme it is, it needs to build a 3D architecture. He first builds the architecture, and then decides the content and theme of the game and adds them to the architecture. If he wants to develop 3D games in the future, the architecture can be used again. This concept didn’t really improve until John kamak’s id software launched the second FPS game “doom”. The development of “doom 2” in a very short cycle can well illustrate this point, because the game engine can be continuously improved, the more perfect, the more efficient.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The higher the level, the crazier In depth understanding of epic's past glory and current difficulties/d76e4ced6ef44e9292528a6408891e7e.jpg" alt="The higher the level, the crazier In depth understanding of epic&#39;s past glory and current difficulties"><br>German headquarters 3D<br>The concept of engine has caused a great sensation in the game development industry. There are such convenient and quick methods that are not really different from fools. Therefore, a large number of people have joined in the research of game engine. The protagonist of our story, Tim Sweeney, is one of these people. Although this person has not developed many games, he has studied engine With great enthusiasm, this person is now the founder of epic company. In 1998, epic company and digital extremes studio in Canada jointly developed an FPS game called unreal, which is based on the engine they developed. Therefore, the name of the engine is also called unreal. This game is very amazing in the view of the screen performance at that time, no matter in the scene construction or map definition, it has a very amazing high quality, and the optimization and fluency of the engine are also very satisfactory. Then the super-high processing performance and fluency of the virtual arena developed by the same engine are enough to illustrate this.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The higher the level, the crazier In depth understanding of epic's past glory and current difficulties/84cddde38c88425092393755df7f2c03.jpg" alt="The higher the level, the crazier In depth understanding of epic&#39;s past glory and current difficulties"><br>Unreal<br>The powerful performance of virtual engine makes many manufacturers covet it. Even John kamak himself praises it. It’s better to buy the off the shelf engine license directly from epic than to work on the engine himself. Isn’t it once and for all? Virtual engine licensing contracts are pouring in, and in a very short period of time, they have reached cooperation with more than ten game manufacturers. Given that the virtual engine is inherently based on FPS games, most of the companies using the virtual engine are also developing shooting games and action games. Epic is not complacent about this, but has stepped up the speed of upgrading the engine. After all, the performance of all kinds of game hardware is gradually improving, which is an opportunity that can not be missed for the improvement of the game screen. After 2000, the unreal 2 engine has raised the average screen standard of the industry to another level. This time, not only is the performance of the screen bright enough, but also has a better physical effect, making the game more immersive. As soon as the engine was announced, more game companies came to seek authorization, and epic officially put its own engine on the shelf as a long-term open business project.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The higher the level, the crazier In depth understanding of epic's past glory and current difficulties/64d2e52c853d4d3ab2bcf093d187e3a6.jpg" alt="The higher the level, the crazier In depth understanding of epic&#39;s past glory and current difficulties"><br>The highest rendering of unreal 4 is almost unreal (see sawtooth)</p>
<h1 id="night-of-Fortress"><a href="#night-of-Fortress" class="headerlink" title="night of Fortress"></a>night of Fortress</h1><p>Until now, the unreal engine has had four major versions of update iterations in total. Now, the Unreal Engine 4 has become a favorite engine of most game developers, not only with moderate price and good performance, but also with the feeling of 3A masterpieces. However, no matter how other manufacturers favor this engine, they can never be more familiar with it than developing epic. Therefore, for many years, no epic has been able to really play the performance of this engine. In the past few years of engine upgrading, epic has never stopped developing games. Unreal arena has been back and forth for several generations. However, due to the cold market of FPs in the arena, they can only choose to put this series aside temporarily. On the other hand, they have tried MoBa games. However, due to the strong strength of competitors and the low publicity, the model named《 It was not long before the MoBa game of Paragon was stopped.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The higher the level, the crazier In depth understanding of epic's past glory and current difficulties/bfc5392e322f4833a3791a4d9334aa6c.jpg" alt="The higher the level, the crazier In depth understanding of epic&#39;s past glory and current difficulties"><br>Illusory hegemony<br>Empty has a hard technology epic fell into confusion, can’t sell the engine for a lifetime, they still want to do the game, so at the completion of unreal 4, they said they would launch the first game using this next generation engine, which is called “night of the fortress”. The original fortress night is a survival game that mainly focuses on cooperation among multiple people. It takes sandbox construction and shooting as its selling point. Although it looks very interesting, many players say that they have been tired of aesthetic appreciation of survival games. Although the quality of this game is good, it is doomed not to be sold. At the same time, there was a “chicken eating craze” in the global market, which caused many manufacturers to follow suit. Epic had a good idea about this. It was based on the cold “night of the fortress” and combined with many features of this survival game to create a big escape game, so the PVP big escape mode of “night of the fortress” came into being, and adopted the free escape mode The operation mode of fee downloading and jewelry charging.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The higher the level, the crazier In depth understanding of epic's past glory and current difficulties/7ba4525eba9d4d219f4ef68a0f5ff2ba.jpg" alt="The higher the level, the crazier In depth understanding of epic&#39;s past glory and current difficulties"><br>Night of the fortress<br>Although the screen of the game is in the humorous cartoon style, the great escape combined with the construction elements undoubtedly has a higher interest, thus forming a game atmosphere of light competition and heavy entertainment. Due to different customs and people, the game is cold in China, but it is quite popular in Europe and the United States. The heat of the game exceeds the Jedi survival (to a large extent) for a long time It is also related to the poor game environment in China. With the help of epic’s hard power, the night of the fortress with unreal 4 is not only fine in picture, but also excellent in optimization. Even when it runs at a low frame rate, it can’t feel the card feeling very much. It has a very low requirement for configuration. On the contrary, the Jedi survival next door is famous for its high requirement for optimized differential configuration, forming a sharp contrast. The game itself is full of fun, humorous and easy, with low configuration requirements and good optimization. Moreover, it is free to play with only accessories. Such a game is hard not to catch fire in overseas areas. Relying on very compact and novel updated content, fortress night has not only become the most popular and best-known big escape game for players, but also makes epic earn a lot of money.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The higher the level, the crazier In depth understanding of epic's past glory and current difficulties/13640dae93f045bf8efd0ed085c58f2f.jpg" alt="The higher the level, the crazier In depth understanding of epic&#39;s past glory and current difficulties"></p>
<h1 id="the-wave-of-the-wind"><a href="#the-wave-of-the-wind" class="headerlink" title="the wave of the wind"></a>the wave of the wind</h1><p>Today’s epic has not only money, but also Tencent’s shares. After all, Tencent is also focused on making fortress night profitable in China. With money and momentum, epic is not only expanding, but also trying to make a big move. That is to build its own game platform and sell other people’s games to make more money. It’s reasonable to say that epic does what it does on the platform, but it has to compete with steam, who can’t fight for eight poles. It complains that 30% of the platform of steam is too high, which is the “cancer” of the game industry, and they only receive 12% of the share, which can make game developers and publishers get higher profits. However, in fact, 30% draw is the industry’s unified standard. Basically all game platforms and even host platforms are charged 30% draw. This standard has lasted for many years, and no one has complained.<br>It’s just epic that is “one of the best”. From a rational point of view, maybe epic’s move is just to attract more game developers and distributors to their platforms, so as to enrich the lineup of the game, so as to attract more players. At the beginning of the launch of bijingping platform, there were only a few independent games with less fame, while the real 3A works were few Less.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The higher the level, the crazier In depth understanding of epic's past glory and current difficulties/533063088a34491aa5e0825ef98ffb0b.jpg" alt="The higher the level, the crazier In depth understanding of epic&#39;s past glory and current difficulties"><br>The most unacceptable thing is that at the beginning of the platform’s launch, not only the stores in China are blocked, but also many long-awaited games are taken away as their own “limited time monopoly”, which has caused the dissatisfaction of quite a number of players. Even the overseas players without the locked area can’t see it. It’s immoral to jump out and accuse epic of this kind of behavior. Although the current epic has opened up the country and region, the trend of monopoly still hasn’t stopped. Instead, it’s to pay more and more money to buy the exclusive right of the game. This money is really quite heavy. Take remedy’s latest game “control” as an example, some financial reports say that epic spent 9.49 million euros, or more than 70 million yuan, to buy the exclusive right of the game A number is really shocking. Today’s epic is sparing no effort to expand its own game lineup. Although it makes players unhappy, why not make more money for other game companies? Especially for many independent game developers, perhaps what they lack is the difference of 18%.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The higher the level, the crazier In depth understanding of epic's past glory and current difficulties/97d0bfa43cc34160ae60d7179a4d4ebb.jpg" alt="The higher the level, the crazier In depth understanding of epic&#39;s past glory and current difficulties"><br>Control<br>    concluding remarks<br>It is undeniable that, although epic’s various operations are very unpopular, but he did make a great contribution to the game development industry, from more and more developers choose to join the ranks of epic is enough to show that there are not only highly used engines, but also original games with high quality and good conscience of operation, and the author is very puzzled that the founder Why does Tim Sweeney want to brush the existence like a clown in a crazy way, not only to provoke the cooperation between platforms, but also to offend the players who have always had a good impression on them, perhaps just because they have the money and the right to be arrogant? I don’t think so. Maybe he did it just to attract other people’s attention. After all, he was willing to cooperate with those game companies. In his eyes, there were only contractual rules and regulations, and he didn’t care what he said to the outside world.<br>In the eyes of outsiders, what epic needs to do now is to find a way to save the word-of-mouth that has plummeted among the players. For developers, the terms of epic are good for themselves, but who can guarantee that epic’s conscience is not just a moment, and will not change from “Dragon Slayer warrior” to the same “dragon” in the future?</p>

    <title>The most powerful player in action role-playing games, Diablo is 23 years old</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/The%20most%20powerful%20player%20in%20action%20role-playing%20games,%20Diablo%20is%2023%20years%20old/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to the word “brush”, it’s estimated that all players will associate RPG with the same type of game. For the new generation of players, it seems that the so-called RPG is the same as those game types of fighting strange explosive equipment. As for whether to shoot with a gun or cut with a sword, it doesn’t matter. The key is whether the players can brush happily. Nowadays, these games are collectively referred to as action role-playing (ARPG). Compared with the traditional turn RPG game, it is undoubtedly more refreshing and addictive. It seems that ARPG is also easier to win the favor of players than the traditional RPG.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The most powerful player in action role-playing games, Diablo is 23 years old/8fbd7c3579dd461d91626a53e3e46741.jpg" alt="The most powerful player in action role-playing games, Diablo is 23 years old"><br>In fact, the type of ARPG is not a very new type, even it has been some years, but to make this type last for a long time, we have to talk about a popular game of ARPG.<br>If you want to choose one of the most popular works from the ARPG game, it is the series “Diablo” produced by Blizzard, and the domestic players prefer to call it “big pineapple”. “Big pineapple” first exposed players to the concept of “brush brush”. Although this game type is not the first one of big pineapple, it has gathered the advantages of other works in the industry, corrected and innovated them, thus gaining an unparalleled position. Now, the highly watched Diablo 4 has finally been officially released, and it’s time to talk about this 23 year old legend series.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The most powerful player in action role-playing games, Diablo is 23 years old/5327f6871fe147e981e9353ec39d5a71.jpg" alt="The most powerful player in action role-playing games, Diablo is 23 years old"><br>Diablo<br>Diablo, the homophonic translation of Diablo, the name can be the meaning of “devil” in Spanish, or the name of the Horned Dragon in “Monster Hunter”. In the game of Diablo, the origin of the name is not so sophisticated, but simply because “father of darkness” David Breivik lived in contracosta County, California, USA as a child Danville, a subordinate City, and not far from his home there is a mountain called Diablo, which is not so famous, but if you climb the top of the mountain, you can see most of California’s scenery. David thinks the name is cool, and he thinks it will be used one day in the future, but he doesn’t know the Spanish meaning of the name. When the game was approved, he hoped to complete his childhood dream, but the meaning coincides with the theme of the game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The most powerful player in action role-playing games, Diablo is 23 years old/7dd783cdd6b04529a345d191926b529b.jpg" alt="The most powerful player in action role-playing games, Diablo is 23 years old"><br>Diablo mountain<br>After growing up, David became a programmer, and established “vulture” studio with two brothers Schaeffer. The design of Diablo was largely influenced by the classic game “rogue” and the game “dragon and dungeon” in his early years, such as random map, falling equipment and props on the computer, round round calculation of fighting monsters, starting from scratch when he died, etc, And the game mode is like “XCOM” like the turn to take the grid. At that time, blizzard was just founded. Before that, vultures and blizzard had met each other at the game exhibition. Blizzard made a lot of money with Warcraft. In order to get development funds, vultures hope to cooperate with blizzard. Blizzard said they can help, but they need to change the game to RTS game mode, and vultures, of course, do No, after all, all their designs for the game are to make the game into a turn system. If it is changed, it is no different from making a new game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The most powerful player in action role-playing games, Diablo is 23 years old/1743e5d104de4b2383cafc1462b30fb4.jpg" alt="The most powerful player in action role-playing games, Diablo is 23 years old"><br>“Rogue”</p>
<h1 id="different-ARPG"><a href="#different-ARPG" class="headerlink" title="different ARPG"></a>different ARPG</h1><p>In order to get the support of Blizzard, David chose to change it. After all, the game can’t be made. It’s useless to say anything. By chance, he tried to set the waiting time of any operation in the game to 0, but it formed a very amazing effect. The protagonist can move freely in the map and fight with the enemy in a fast-paced and non delayed manner , although the mechanism is basically the same as the original idea, it makes the game play much more enjoyable. Strictly speaking, the modified “Diablo” is more like a disguised RTS game, but only one person can control the unit. Blizzard hopes to change the game to RTS just because it wants to abandon the turn system design, but the modified result is beyond Blizzard’s expectation. It immediately decides to buy the vulture and put the game into the bag, so the vulture is renamed blizzard In the north, the development conditions of Diablo are much better.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The most powerful player in action role-playing games, Diablo is 23 years old/58e78da395d24dff88437c2a4a6fe968.jpg" alt="The most powerful player in action role-playing games, Diablo is 23 years old"><br>Dark destroyer<br>The first generation of “Diablo” was born in 1996. Its playing method has been a very familiar upgraded explosive equipment for fighting monsters. Blizzard has added the function of multi person online to the game, which makes the playability and variables of the game improve again. Although it has no brain to play, it is far less profound than the traditional round RPG, but it makes the players realize that the original RPG game is also the first time It can be so refreshing. The theme of “Diablo” refers to the horror stories and films and TV works of Gothic style in the early years. It has a dark style comparable to it. Meanwhile, Blizzard hopes to introduce some bloody and violent elements into the game, which can add a unique aesthetic feeling to the game. In the early years, the refreshing type of game is represented by “destroyer” I think maybe these elements can make the game more comfortable, but it turns out that even the early generation works are still very cool when playing, but it’s easy to get tired after a long time.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The most powerful player in action role-playing games, Diablo is 23 years old/a9e5b05174184485aaaa02215d855748.jpg" alt="The most powerful player in action role-playing games, Diablo is 23 years old"><br>It’s easy to see such a picture for a long time</p>
<p>After the first generation of games went on the market, they were highly praised and became Blizzard’s best-selling works next to Warcraft II. Many media gave them full marks or nearly full marks. Although they were not suitable for children to play, they could not deny their excellent quality. After the success of the first generation of works, Blizzard began to take advantage of the hot iron to prepare for the sequel. With the foresight of the first generation, they also have more and more interesting ideas and inspiration for this game. Although the development of the second generation largely reuses the materials in the previous work, it has made great efforts in the type, attribute, value of the equipment and the talent skills of each profession, which greatly improves the playability of the game itself. With a more perfect battle net online system, the players can also get a better online experience when online, and different players and different professions at the same time Different skills can combine different effects to make the game more profound. According to blizzard, it seems that dark 2 is the complete version of the game in their mind.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The most powerful player in action role-playing games, Diablo is 23 years old/502c597715cd4302a9c84a94fce56f8c.jpg" alt="The most powerful player in action role-playing games, Diablo is 23 years old"><br>Diablo 2<br>I don’t think I need to introduce the influence of Diablo 2 too much here. Quite a few players are exposed to Blizzard from this game, and Blizzard is also famous in the real sense of this game. Even the most well-known “StarCraft” and “world of Warcraft 3” are all works from behind. Unfortunately, due to the internal reasons of the company’s senior management, several core members and founders of beiblizzard left Blizzard not long after the development of the expansion film “king of destruction”. At that time, the development of “Diablo 3” was close to 50%. After reading their development content, Blizzard headquarters, which lost several core creators, thought that the design of the game did not match theirs, so it decided to overturn and redo the whole thing. The former blizzard was disbanded, and the remaining employees either joined the headquarters or lost their jobs, which was the whole 11 years. During this period, too many games had covered the light of dark.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The most powerful player in action role-playing games, Diablo is 23 years old/c945939ef07a4b00bccbccdeedb5a4c1.jpg" alt="The most powerful player in action role-playing games, Diablo is 23 years old"><br>Most people are more familiar with this picture<br>    concluding remarks<br>And the following story is probably known to the fans of Diablo: Although the online Diablo 3 in 2012 has been improved in all aspects in terms of system and screen, the quality of the game can’t be compared with that of the previous work, and then it gradually recovers the reputation by continuous updating and improvement, but it still fails to reach the height of the previous work. It seems that Blizzard’s “Diablo 3” is not the work that fans expect, which directly leads to that the work has not had the same high degree of attention in the following years, and even Blizzard has no plan for the future of the game itself.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The most powerful player in action role-playing games, Diablo is 23 years old/794d8a90e56148e7a6e2b6a1143f3986.jpg" alt="The most powerful player in action role-playing games, Diablo is 23 years old"><br>Dark 3 is not a failure, but it is not a success. This failure may be remembered by Blizzard for a lifetime. From the media reports, it seems that dark 4 finally has its own flavor. As for whether Blizzard can get back the bad food in Dark 4, that’s another story.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>Recently, in addition to lesha’s Alchemy workshop, the most topical game works in the game circle, I’m afraid that the latest 3A masterpiece “action of the ghost: breakpoint” which Ubisoft touts is included. The former is more joking and expectation, while the latter is qingyishui’s “bad comment”. As for why “ghost action: breakpoint” suffered such a Waterloo like public praise slump, I believe that all the players who have a little knowledge of the game should know that there will be no more details here. For “breakpoint”, players should also spray, and the limelight is almost over. This work has become the second worst work after “soul fighter: RC League” this year.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The older, the more perplexed, and the more embarrassed to conform to the masses/564e573c0c9645dd9eefa0db2b702386.jpg" alt="The older, the more perplexed, and the more embarrassed to conform to the masses"><br>Interestingly, in combination with the development trend of the whole “ghost action” in the past and some development ideas of Ubisoft for its own games in recent years, it seems that the word-of-mouth death of “breakpoint” is also expected, and for the whole IP of “ghost action”, it is indeed going downhill now. If “ghost action” wants to get on the right track, it’s not difficult. It’s only necessary to know where the problem is, when it comes out, who it comes out of and then modify it. It seems that the biggest problem of Ubisoft at present is that they don’t know what the problem is. After all, even if the game is not good enough, it really makes them real gold.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The older, the more perplexed, and the more embarrassed to conform to the masses/5af96faeb2854e47a3111db7ab7e93a3.jpg" alt="The older, the more perplexed, and the more embarrassed to conform to the masses"></p>
<p>#”Rainbow Six” in the valley<br>If you want to know what’s wrong with ghost action, you need to start with his first story. Among the most popular FPS games nowadays, one of them is from Ubisoft. Its name is Rainbow Six: siege. Siege is probably the most viscous game work of the players since its establishment. Since this generation, they have developed siege on the scale of an e-competitive FPS and provided long-term and stable content updates Until now, there is still a very stable and huge group of players in the world, and the world-wide E-sports events are also very similar. Although the style of besiege is quite different from that of his previous works, it still doesn’t get out of his core “tactical shooting game”, which emphasizes more on the tactical cooperation between players than focusing on shooting techniques, and it’s the day when Rainbow Six was born that makes it look very tall.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The older, the more perplexed, and the more embarrassed to conform to the masses/44316e55035646319553bf3b6570d6d3.jpg" alt="The older, the more perplexed, and the more embarrassed to conform to the masses"><br>Rainbow Six: Siege<br>The first rainbow six was released in 1998, and shortly after it was released, red storm, the development team, started to develop another game. Unlike the indoor raid of rainbow six, this time they moved the game map to a larger field, and a special combat team went to the enemy’s stronghold to carry out combat tasks that were not much different from rainbow six. This one The game is “ghost action”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The older, the more perplexed, and the more embarrassed to conform to the masses/4b3bb708d3cd4f678ce8846df3ecbee8.jpg" alt="The older, the more perplexed, and the more embarrassed to conform to the masses"><br>Rainbow Six<br>The highlight of the first generation of “ghost action” is that players can immediately give instructions to AI teammates in the process of the game for tactical cooperation, and players can use any way to perform tasks unlimited, as long as they can achieve their goals, they can do whatever they want, without the restriction of “Rainbow six” to ensure the safety of hostages. But even so, players still need to be careful. After all, there are few enemies and their firepower is much lower than that of the enemy. How to finish the task smoothly under the condition of ensuring the safety of their own side is the most challenging play method of the series. The system design of the first generation of “ghost action” can be described by the word “hard core”. In view of the hard core game has always been called good or not, the sales volume of the first generation of “ghost action” is not very high, although it has a good reputation, but it does exceed the company’s expectations.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The older, the more perplexed, and the more embarrassed to conform to the masses/1ca0fc2dcca54d1987775dc8ce03141e.jpg" alt="The older, the more perplexed, and the more embarrassed to conform to the masses"><br>Operation ghost</p>
<p>#Small success<br>In the later works, red strom began to adopt the more common game design at present, which reduced the difficulty of the game, such as the characters on their own side can bear more damage, can be rescued by teammates after being injured instead of being paralyzed directly, cancel the setting of permanent death, and change the Perspective of the game to a more fashionable third person cross shoulder perspective. Compared with the early generation, the follow-up series “ghost action 2” and “ghost action: peak warrior” have more abundant action systems, which make the battle more refreshing and exciting. After all, there is no fixed game playing method in this series. Some people just don’t want to slowly sneak with patience, so the development team specially strengthened the content beyond sneaking, but at the same time, it also made the greatest progress Degree retains the core of the original tactical cooperation content. In the game, it’s easier and faster to give instructions to teammates in real time, rather than open the map and plan everything as before, which greatly improves the fluency of the game process, and “peak warrior” has become the most acclaimed work in the series.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The older, the more perplexed, and the more embarrassed to conform to the masses/367c0a861cbf43a5a9d9762e1c998e6b.jpg" alt="The older, the more perplexed, and the more embarrassed to conform to the masses"><br>Operation Ghost: the pinnacle Warrior<br>And the real work that most players start to contact with this series is “ghost action: Future Warrior”, which is the first attempt of the series to bring the story background to the near future, and provides more sci-fi weapons and equipment, such as optical camouflage and thermal perspective equipment, which can be used by their own side. The cool art style has been used in Hollywood movie style script performances For the players left a deep impression, although the media evaluation of this work is not as good as the previous work, but its influence is not less than the same period of “quality effect”, and this time the host version performance finally boasted, there was a time when “future fighter” was also one of the most popular multiplayer online games on the host.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The older, the more perplexed, and the more embarrassed to conform to the masses/dff90994c3c243b29d11256ef4c1546b.jpg" alt="The older, the more perplexed, and the more embarrassed to conform to the masses"><br>Operation Ghost: Future Warrior</p>
<h1 id="keep-pace-with-the-times"><a href="#keep-pace-with-the-times" class="headerlink" title="keep pace with the times"></a>keep pace with the times</h1><p>From the beginning to the end, this series takes semi open world design as the tradition, making each map small, precise and solid. In 2017, after five years, Ubisoft launched its most ambitious generation of works, ghost action: wilderness, which is the first time in the series to use the open world, and contains a scaled down map of Bolivia, the scale of which is beyond the reach of many games at that time. However, at that time, Ubisoft indulged in a highly repetitive “formulaic open world”. Although there was a large-scale and beautiful map, we could roughly divide the map into several small pieces, and the content of each small piece was almost the same. From the main line to the branch line to the collection of elements and random events, it seemed that there were only differences in environment and main factors The difference of the plot.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The older, the more perplexed, and the more embarrassed to conform to the masses/5b78c3f7fcc54f4990460b5650c0fdd9.jpg" alt="The older, the more perplexed, and the more embarrassed to conform to the masses"><br>Ghost action: Wilderness<br>In short, Ubisoft wants players to experience super high freedom battle match with the help of the open world. In terms of playing style, it is similar to “alloy equipment 5: phantom pain”, but there is a huge and beautiful map available. Although the core content of tactical shooting is perfect in essence, as an open world game, it is too empty. Besides, operation ghost Series to outdoor tactical shooting as a selling point, tactical choice of freedom is needed, but the open world is really not necessary. From the wilderness, we can see that Ubisoft is planning to establish a general setting of “Tom Clancy universe”. The series of works adopt a fixed framework, including world outlook and character relationship, etc. the latest work breakpoint is such a work, just because the game itself wants to add various elements to highlight the concept of all aspects, but it is practical On the other hand, they didn’t focus on any aspect and didn’t perform well in any aspect. At the same time, they lost the core playing method of the ghost action series, which eventually led to the death of word-of-mouth of the game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The older, the more perplexed, and the more embarrassed to conform to the masses/c6d5c5873dde4586836a9db61a497151.jpg" alt="The older, the more perplexed, and the more embarrassed to conform to the masses"><br>    concluding remarks<br>As a long-standing game series with a history of nearly 20 years, “ghost action” has been trying to constantly improve since its first sequel and introduce more game elements that are more easily accepted by people at present. This has also been effective. After all, previous generations of works have achieved good results in sales volume and public praise, but they are not complacent Instead, they choose to try new things in every generation. Instead of inheriting the previous excellent design, they always want to be able to cross the existing achievements and move to a new field, but in the end, it backfires. Like Icarus in Greek mythology, they always want to fly higher, but fall into the sea because of melting their wings.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The older, the more perplexed, and the more embarrassed to conform to the masses/4bbda50ed58d4b12b5aab57c49050133.jpg" alt="The older, the more perplexed, and the more embarrassed to conform to the masses"><br>It’s a good thing to add pop elements to the old game, but it’s not a bad thing to keep the original core all the time. From the development cycle of breakpoint for only more than two years, we can know that this game may only be an accessory product created by reusing the previous materials, just like “Assassin’s Creed: Xiao Xiong” is to “the great revolution”, but from the preview of the game The core of breakpoint is not the game itself. It seems that they also know what the game is like, which is doomed to be a thunder work. But it’s ironic that even though the word-of-mouth of breakpoint died, it still easily achieved sales of tens of millions. Ubisoft naturally has plans to launch a sequel, but we don’t know what kind of changes they will make this time.</p>

    <title>The originator of the big escape game, the rescue work of h1z1 failed</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/The%20originator%20of%20the%20big%20escape%20game,%20the%20rescue%20work%20of%20h1z1%20failed/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>The type of big escape game has been born for some time. Although its popularity has declined, it has never faded out of the players’ vision. It is largely related to the segmentation of multiple games. Today’s big escape game has changed from the original one to the present one. With the participation of many front-line manufacturers, the competition in this market is also fierce It became intense.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The originator of the big escape game, the rescue work of h1z1 failed/bab528070e944517966918908584af02.jpg" alt="The originator of the big escape game, the rescue work of h1z1 failed"><br>At present, there are many successful works, among which the most famous and discussed one is the well-known “survival of the Jedi”. As an action shooting game, its influence is so great that many players who never contact with the game, especially the shooting game, are attracted into the pit. Regardless of the reputation, survival of the Jedi has made great success in business at least. But who can remember that there was a big hit before Jedi. Its name is h1z1, which is not strange to many players, but not many people will try the game again. Today, it has only 300 people a day and less than 200 people online. It seems that the end of the game has entered the countdown.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The originator of the big escape game, the rescue work of h1z1 failed/acec979ce5ef401cb6e63c26fadb4a11.jpg" alt="The originator of the big escape game, the rescue work of h1z1 failed"><br>Now renamed “Z1 escape”</p>
<h1 id="great-original"><a href="#great-original" class="headerlink" title="great original"></a>great original</h1><p>The game mode of “big escape” is not originated from the game, but from a Japanese horror novel named “big escape”, which was later adapted into a movie and known to people. In this movie, a group of students are required to kill each other on an uninhabited island until one person survives, so as to cultivate a person with the perseverance to survive as a useful talent of the country.<br>Although the film is controversial all over the world, it is also a good quality work and has a certain influence all over the world. Born in Ireland and living in Brazil, Brandon green is a game mod author. He is also deeply influenced by the movie. He successively made the most important rules of the movie into mod and added them to the military sandbox simulation game “Armed Assault 2” and its sequel. Although this mode is more interesting, because of the extremely low popularity of “armed assault” and the extremely high difficulty of the game, only that Some players who like “armed raids” are keen on this mode. It’s hard, but it’s fun.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The originator of the big escape game, the rescue work of h1z1 failed/4d87e3eebcf14ec296b75599079f58d4.jpg" alt="The originator of the big escape game, the rescue work of h1z1 failed"><br>Armed raids Dayz Mod<br>In the mod of “armed raid 3”, players need to choose their own airborne location by plane. After landing, they need to collect props and weapons. The range of survival will continue to narrow. The goal of players is to be the last survivor. At that time, the mod was spread in this not too big circle. It was favored by many players with the rules of intense stimulation, and also attracted the attention of Sony online entertainment (SOE).<br>SOE found Brandon, and they hope to add the same big escape game as Brandon’s mod to their already launched multiplayer online survival game h1z1. Brandon said he would go as long as he could pay. In SOE, Brandon was hired as the technical consultant of the big escape mode, and spent several months in SOE. After the completion of the big escape mode, he went back to work on his mod. After the game went public, h1z1 surpassed many popular games of steam platform in just one week and became the sales champion at that time.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The originator of the big escape game, the rescue work of h1z1 failed/dbbdcbdaa6b143f4bfdf0aa7463926c5.jpg" alt="The originator of the big escape game, the rescue work of h1z1 failed"><br>“Father of chicken” Brandon green<br>In fact, the reason why h1z1 can be popular has nothing to do with whether it is a survival game or not. Almost all the credit should be attributed to the big escape mode. Players are buying the game for this mode. In 2016, daybreak, the studio of SOE, took over the operation of the game and made a game out of the main body, which is the familiar h1z1: the king of killing.<br>Fortunately, at that time, when the game live broadcasting industry was just emerging, king of killing itself had a very high playability, and even watching others play it also had a very good program effect. The hosts all liked to choose this game to rub off a wave of enthusiasm. In this situation, king of killing really ushered in his peak. At the same time, the game At one time, the number of online players exceeded 100000, and the sales volume of the game quickly exceeded one million. With the help of the hosts, the number of players in the game is increasing day by day.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The originator of the big escape game, the rescue work of h1z1 failed/1c76c1bf9d1b4546a9ec8c44bd4721d9.jpg" alt="The originator of the big escape game, the rescue work of h1z1 failed"><br>Initial game map</p>
<h1 id="external-worries-and-internal-troubles"><a href="#external-worries-and-internal-troubles" class="headerlink" title="external worries and internal troubles"></a>external worries and internal troubles</h1><p>There is a common phenomenon in the game circle, especially in the field of online games. If more people play a game, the environment of this game will become worse, especially in the Chinese market. The proliferation of players has not only increased the frequency of plug-ins, but also led many Chinese players to set up a red army in King of killing. As long as they meet in red, they are friends, and take the national curse as the “joint code”. They ignore the matching mechanism of the game, attack other players in groups, and extremely destroy the game experience of other ordinary players, so that Xu Many foreign players are forced to wear red clothes and learn from national scolding. Overseas players complain that they have no experience in playing games. Daybreak, the operator, decides to take measures. Although the behavior of the “Red Army” has seriously damaged the fairness of the game and belongs to the category of malicious team formation, it is wordless that they have chosen the most extreme measure: blocking the IP in mainland China.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The originator of the big escape game, the rescue work of h1z1 failed/a0ba8590ecdf4faf8d9a5d1e177f3b80.jpg" alt="The originator of the big escape game, the rescue work of h1z1 failed"><br>You should know that at that time, “king of killing” had a considerable player base from China, they were the main player group and the biggest consumer of the game, but daybreak directly blocked the Chinese IP and did not allow Chinese players to go online. What’s more confusing is that Mingming has locked the Chinese IP, but the Chinese players can still buy the game, and the players who buy the game will not go to the game for some reason, on the other hand, it is enough to see that daybreak’s operation concept of the game is not right. Soon after the IP was locked, Jedi survival appeared. Compared with king of killing, it has a better game picture and a more comprehensive game system. Therefore, players at home and abroad have turned to Jedi survival, and those who once set up the Red Army in King of killing and opened an external hook have taken the opportunity to harm Jedi survival.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The originator of the big escape game, the rescue work of h1z1 failed/490bb86339e84fd2b7b9902a350290f2.jpg" alt="The originator of the big escape game, the rescue work of h1z1 failed"><br>The Jedi survive<br>Not to mention what happened in Jedi survival, the protagonist of our story is still the king of killing. This is its first cold. First, it cuts the largest group of its own, and then it is exploited by its competitors. What the king of killing has to do is to recover its market. In March last year, the game finally ended the EA preemptive experience stage and ushered in the official version. The king of killing also confirmed that it was renamed as h1z1: big escape.<br>At the same time, the game adopts the operation mode of free play, internal purchase and charging, and the ban on the mainland IP is lifted, making the number of game players break the new record again, but the following is that the poor evaluation of the game also breaks the new record, only one day, more than 2000 bad evaluations are received, and the content of the bad evaluation is nothing more than that the game changes from paying to free, and the external connection is still rampant, and the operators unlock the mainland IP And so on. But even if the number of players has picked up, at this time, “survival of the Jedi” can be said to have occupied half of the big escape game, “with a better, why play that laggard?” I believe most old players think so, and the failure of h1z1 is only a matter of time.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The originator of the big escape game, the rescue work of h1z1 failed/74ab7d8b4bb248ca9cb94d6774d4e1aa.jpg" alt="The originator of the big escape game, the rescue work of h1z1 failed"><br>The updated publicity map is really attractive to the players who have not been exposed to it<br>End of<br>In August last year, daybreak shut down the server of h1z1: survive and focused on the update of big escape, but it seems to have little effect. It seems that daybreak can’t help the game for a while. In March this year, daybreak replaced the operation and development of the game to nantg studio, and the game was renamed as “Z1 big escape”.<br>The new owner seems to find that the game can’t be saved after trying to operate it, so only a month later, he returned the management right of the game to daybreak, and nantg went to develop a mobile game. At that time, the number of online players in the game was up to nearly 5000, while today, the number of daily players in the game is only 300, with a game supporting 150 people, while the existing players can make the game play three games at the same time, which is very bleak.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The originator of the big escape game, the rescue work of h1z1 failed/f60632374f184522a7b01bc36b3bf8fb.jpg" alt="The originator of the big escape game, the rescue work of h1z1 failed"><br>Data as of the date of writing<br>If daybreak had promised to keep updating and operating as long as there are players playing, but in the current situation, it seems that the game has no value worth updating and maintaining, far less direct than trying other projects. The biggest reason for the failure of “Z1 escape” lies in the operator’s carelessness, the low level of rectification of the external problems, and the isolation of the largest group of players in the game in a one size fits all way. It is clear that he had the chance to become famous. If he could do these works well, he might not have the chance to succeed in “survival of the Jedi”, and he would not go to the end of the world like today Step. Ironically, the producer of “the Jedi survives” was Braden green, the technical consultant of “king of killing”, who killed his former partner.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>At the end of last month, the RPG game “horse riding and killing 2: Lord”, which has been eagerly awaited by numerous players, officially announced that it will carry out limited game testing, and will soon release a public test. It’s been 11 years since the game was released. Before that, the players’ cognition of qihew 2 was only in the development log released by the developer taleworlds every other time. It’s hard to update the development log, but it’s too late to know when the game will be finished and listed. And the news of this test really makes many players who have waited for the flowers to fade one after another to have a chance to see the real face of the game in person.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The production of rough pictures is backward, but the sequel can make players wait 11 years for horse riding and killing/1440020262694127a1e821169f198629.jpg" alt="The production of rough pictures is backward, but the sequel can make players wait 11 years for horse riding and killing"><br>A good game doesn’t need a very good picture, and it doesn’t need a good handle, in the end, as long as it’s fun enough. “Horse riding and chop” is a rough game, but it is still active in the past 11 years. Even the well-known longevity game “ancient scroll 5” is only eight years. Some people may say that the reason why the game can survive today is that it is inseparable from the community and mod, which is no problem, but this is only one of the reasons for its vitality.</p>
<p>#A game that   doesn’t play for<br>In 2005, an independent game called “warrior” began to spread in the forum of Military game enthusiasts. This is a medieval background simulation war RPG game, in which players can form their own troops and lead them to the battlefield. The picture of the game is very rough, but this kind of slightly unique playing method seems very interesting to people. And the biggest highlight of the game is that this work is just like ancient scroll 3. Even if the players don’t do anything, all kinds of things are happening in different parts of the world. There are NPC from different countries and regions fighting with people from other countries everywhere. The goal of the players is to strengthen their own forces and drive out several other major NPC’s to kill the whole continent This kind of playing method is not uncommon in strategy games, but it is unprecedented in an ARPG game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The production of rough pictures is backward, but the sequel can make players wait 11 years for horse riding and killing/2337036af805499cae9d39b1a97e698b.jpg" alt="The production of rough pictures is backward, but the sequel can make players wait 11 years for horse riding and killing"><br>The similarity between “warrior” and “riding and chopping” can be seen<br>The rough little game became popular, and two developers of the homeopathy game became known: armagan Yavuz, from Turkey, and his wife Ipek, who worked with him to develop the game. Although the production of the game is rough, it has a high degree of completion in content. When the media asked why they want to make such a game, they said that the main reason is that the games on the market can’t meet their tastes. They just want to make a product they want. Many players said that if they have the idea of polishing the game and selling it on the market, They are willing to help the couple.<br>The so-called encouragement of players is the greatest support for developers. The couple readily agreed, and then they quit their original job with one bite of their teeth and one foot of their feet. They focused on making games, and set up taleworlds for other players to communicate with each other and share game development tools. At this stage, the name of the game was changed from warrior to Mount &amp; blade and sell game serial numbers online to maintain game development.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The production of rough pictures is backward, but the sequel can make players wait 11 years for horse riding and killing/8b7eb149442a459c8e9fef2ae3a4f532.jpg" alt="The production of rough pictures is backward, but the sequel can make players wait 11 years for horse riding and killing"><br>At present, the group photo of taleworlds team is Yavuz in the middle and wife Ipek in the right</p>
<h1 id="famous"><a href="#famous" class="headerlink" title="famous"></a>famous</h1><p>Few people know that in the whole taleworlds, most of the members are the authors who have made mod specially for other games. They are not so much “involved in game development” as developing mod for this game. In fact, it’s true that the finished product of “horse riding and cutting” is almost like a piece of work made of countless mods. By the time of signing with Paradox Interactive (P club for short) in 2007, the game had risen from 24MB at the beginning to 280MB, more than tenfold. Every design idea and inspiration in the game comes from the players in various forums and the mod authors who participated in the development. For the great progress of the game, the couple expressed their gratitude for all the participation in the development of the game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The production of rough pictures is backward, but the sequel can make players wait 11 years for horse riding and killing/374bb9fbf96d4c1f9daf0a7ca6958241.jpg" alt="The production of rough pictures is backward, but the sequel can make players wait 11 years for horse riding and killing"><br>Screenshot of early game<br>In 2008, the official version of the game finally went public with the help of P club, which is now known as the “original”. In the initial version, the game is just a medieval game worthy of the name of horse fight, but compared with the “initial version” a few years ago, the content and map of the game are much larger than the original scale, and before the release, the development team also added the “Friendliness” between the “camp” system and each NPC to the game.<br>But when the game is officially released, there are hundreds of game MODS and dozens of game mods produced by the community members of taleworlds. Yes, you can even write your own script for the game (similar to the expansion film, which can experience different content from the original version). With the good reputation accumulated before going public, the game sold 1 million sets when it was officially launched, and the players and the media were also highly praised.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The production of rough pictures is backward, but the sequel can make players wait 11 years for horse riding and killing/d8a3403626d54c149c5894b9be339b3b.jpg" alt="The production of rough pictures is backward, but the sequel can make players wait 11 years for horse riding and killing"><br>Original game cover<br>When the game was not officially launched, there were many fans of “qihew” on the other side of the ocean. At that time, the name of “qihew” was not known. The real opportunity for the game to become known to most people is the release of the independent expansion film “riding and chopping: Battle Group” two years later. In this expansion, the development team added political system, marriage system and multiplayer online to the game, but expanded various new contents, making the game more like a “medieval Simulator” in the overall experience.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The production of rough pictures is backward, but the sequel can make players wait 11 years for horse riding and killing/b02ec0e9a5e14a42af9dc4c937a8569d.jpg" alt="The production of rough pictures is backward, but the sequel can make players wait 11 years for horse riding and killing"><br>This picture is familiar to all players of “riding and chopping”<br>Players can do what they want to do in the real sense of the overhead medieval world. You can recruit members to set up their own doors, or you can choose to join other countries to instigate relations between countries to reap the benefits, or you can be a wilderness Ranger exploring the mainland, or you can be a businessman and peddler doing business. For the players who don’t like the overhead world very much, the developers have also launched fire and sword, an independent documentary based on the real historical background. With the help of P club’s development of historical strategy games over the years, the inside information and connotation of the series of riding and chopping are becoming more and more profound, both in political design and historical restoration are very careful and rigorous.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The production of rough pictures is backward, but the sequel can make players wait 11 years for horse riding and killing/85c501e975944a1da9e27f3fbda9d5b8.jpg" alt="The production of rough pictures is backward, but the sequel can make players wait 11 years for horse riding and killing"><br>In fire and sword, firearm and more perfect economic system are added, but the heat is far less than that of the War Regiment</p>
<h1 id="tail-the-next-step-is-the-future"><a href="#tail-the-next-step-is-the-future" class="headerlink" title="tail: the next step is the future"></a>tail: the next step is the future</h1><p>“My world” sells well. In fact, it’s also an independent game. No matter how high the game quality of “ride and chop” is, it can’t be called 3a. These two games have a common feature, that is, they look very rough, even rough, but they are very fun, the fun even many 3A works can not match. Riding and chopping can only be achieved so far with the attention of the fans and the perseverance of the producers. Back to the question we mentioned at the beginning, why the vitality of riding and chopping series can be longer than that of laogun5? The existence of mod and the open-source nature of the game ontology are just one of the reasons. The main reason is that it has the measurement of being able to contain all kinds of rivers.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The production of rough pictures is backward, but the sequel can make players wait 11 years for horse riding and killing/317a73658b774a008b854ffd374235ee.jpg" alt="The production of rough pictures is backward, but the sequel can make players wait 11 years for horse riding and killing"><br>Although there is no huge and beautiful map in the game, and even the monarch of each city can only live in a small one mu and three Fen land, the whole game has the freedom that many masterpieces cannot give. It doesn’t matter that the details are not enough, but as a medieval RPG game, it has everything it should have and everything it doesn’t have. The game doesn’t force the players to do anything. The task is just a simple goal. The rest is left to the players’ own judgment. Compared with the “high freedom” and “open world” in other masterpieces, even in the Middle Ages In the case of insufficient technical force, it is obvious that the world of “riding and chopping” should be more free and open.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The production of rough pictures is backward, but the sequel can make players wait 11 years for horse riding and killing/1a5a3dbd13ba4b828bc02eef0c56287d.jpg" alt="The production of rough pictures is backward, but the sequel can make players wait 11 years for horse riding and killing"><br>You said that the hardcore of “qihewan”, the first one in “heaven: save”, was not satisfied. You said that “qihewan” is true. On details reduction, there are many games that can hang “qihewan”. Some people may say that “you can’t compare a game more than ten years ago with the current game”. But the reality is that although “qihewan” is very good in gameplay, it has been a game after all Behind the product of the times, and looking at the next generation will come, “qihew 2” is still slow to move.<br>The so-called waiting for the game to be released is like waiting for a new update. The more you love him, the more anxious you will feel. But even after so many years, we have waited. It doesn’t matter if the development team continues to polish it. It’s just a sincere hope that on the day when “qihew 2” is actually released, we can live up to the expectations of so many players we are looking forward to.</p>

    <title>The rise and fall of 37 years, the first brother of Marvel spider man&#39;s turnaround in the game world</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/The%20rise%20and%20fall%20of%2037%20years,%20the%20first%20brother%20of%20Marvel%20spider%20man&#39;s%20turnaround%20in%20the%20game%20world/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Recently, there have been a lot of news surrounding the name “Spider Man”. First, Sony announced the acquisition of I   n   somniac games, the developer of PS4 exclusive game “Marvel Spider Man”, and then, because of the disagreement between Sony and Disney, the IP of “Spider Man” will be separated from Marvel movie universe. The former hasn’t caused much trouble. After all, insumniac Games has been developing exclusive games for Sony as a third party, while the latter has caused the dissatisfaction of many spider man fans. I hope Sony can allow the “little spider” to stay in MCU.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The rise and fall of 37 years, the first brother of Marvel spider man's turnaround in the game world/8ccb5df3a7114c0e838e775d60c865f9.jpg" alt="The rise and fall of 37 years, the first brother of Marvel spider man&#39;s turnaround in the game world"><br>Compared with the latter, the former is more concerned by the author. All the players who are concerned about the console game should know that this marvel spider man, although not a masterpiece, has become the best-selling superhero game in the history of the game. Sony’s acquisition is very likely to be ready to serialize this IP. If we can keep the quality of the game and serialize it, it is undoubtedly a good thing for fans. After all, although the IP of spider man is well-known and has numerous derivative game works, there are few masterpieces that can be really remembered by players.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The rise and fall of 37 years, the first brother of Marvel spider man's turnaround in the game world/d062da0443c7485ea516d11275d228e3.jpg" alt="The rise and fall of 37 years, the first brother of Marvel spider man&#39;s turnaround in the game world"></p>
<p>#Before 2000<br>The original series of Spider Man comics was originally written by the original “Marvel” (later renamed Marvel) company, and it was the first work with teenagers as the main characters. This adolescent high school student named “Peter Parker” had some narcissism and autistic, and this character image aroused the resonance of many young readers, so this character was very popular among young people. We should know that the group of young people is a very large market. If we capture them, we will get the market of many other products. The sales volume of toys, books, clothing and a series of other products will naturally increase. Of course, the electronic games are indispensable.<br>In the 1980s, yadali company started a “video game fever” in Europe and the United States. Almost everyone was fascinated by video games. At this time, if a “Spider Man” game came out in the limelight, it would sell well. Therefore, the first game in the history of “Spider Man” was logged into yadali 2600 platform. The game’s playing method is very simple, just to control a person who looks like Spiderman barely trying to climb a skyscraper to contact the time bomb set by the Green Devils. During the climbing, something will fall in the sky from time to time, and there will be enemies in the window of the building to block the progress of Spiderman. In short, this is an agile game, very boring And the operation is very awkward, people can’t understand.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The rise and fall of 37 years, the first brother of Marvel spider man's turnaround in the game world/4b737b687dfa44039b34f38ade8688b7.jpg" alt="The rise and fall of 37 years, the first brother of Marvel spider man&#39;s turnaround in the game world"><br>Yadali 2600 spider man<br>Players like spider man so much that they don’t want such a game. Soon after that, Paragon software, a game company, launched a horizontal game called “the amazing spider man and Captain America in Doctor Doom’s Revenge” in the 1990s. In this game Finally, players can control Spiderman to fight against the enemies of the crime blaster. This game is the first horizontal action game in the market of Spiderman series. It not only lays a template for the future game of Spiderman, but also is the leader of other superhero games.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The rise and fall of 37 years, the first brother of Marvel spider man's turnaround in the game world/cc46d968bd334b26ad338a9ce757e03b.jpg" alt="The rise and fall of 37 years, the first brother of Marvel spider man&#39;s turnaround in the game world"><br>Amiga game “spider man and revenge of the American captain on Dr. doom”</p>
<p>#Film wave<br>In 2000, the game has completely entered the 3D era. In this year, Activision company obtained the production copyright of spider man game, and launched the first 3D work “spider man 2000” in the history of spider man, and landed three mainstream game consoles and two mainstream PC platforms at that time. This work was developed by Neversoft studio of Activision. For this reason, developers designed various systems to cope with the unique settings of spider man, such as rope swinging, wall climbing, spider silk launching and all-round three-dimensional combat. This difficult project was handed over to a previous only done “Tony Hawk professional skateboard”, which is a little bit so far. Fortunately, they finished it, but they just didn’t The quality of the game is not so satisfactory. Because it’s a first attempt work, there are always some deficiencies in the concept, and there are also big problems in the operation design of the game, but fortunately, it gives the latter a hint, so that they can know what a 3D spider man should be made.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The rise and fall of 37 years, the first brother of Marvel spider man's turnaround in the game world/8679cbd2262348fdb842d588ffbc8b50.jpg" alt="The rise and fall of 37 years, the first brother of Marvel spider man&#39;s turnaround in the game world"><br>PS spider man 2000<br>In 2002, Sony announced that it would launch a big production real life superhero movie of Spiderman in May, which exploded the whole film and television field. As a pre release warm-up, Activision will launch a game of the same name based on the film template on PS2 platform. Game development and film production are even a little earlier than film production. Therefore, the content of the game must be different from that of the film. After experiencing the lessons of the last time, this time, Activision gave the development of the game to its treyarch studio (representative work “call of Duty: black action”). Based on the previous generation of 3D works, the film is widely used in this work The bridge section and design in are fully consistent with the movie content, but how can the content of a movie support a large-scale game? Therefore, team t has added some bridge sections and characters in the game that only appear in comics.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The rise and fall of 37 years, the first brother of Marvel spider man's turnaround in the game world/20fd8202bf7e4cd68e6b7a59f5d4571c.jpg" alt="The rise and fall of 37 years, the first brother of Marvel spider man&#39;s turnaround in the game world"><br>PS2 spider man: movie version<br>This action game called spider man: the movie was launched half a month before the movie was released. As a warm-up game for a movie, it has a pretty good quality, and the content of the game is worth playing many times. After all, it can directly experience the plot in the movie (although there are differences), and the overall quality is good, but it can not satisfy most people 。 We all know that “Spider Man” starring Toby Maguire has launched three works, which can be called a generation of classics, while the adaptation game has also launched three works. Although each generation is gradually improving in the picture and details, the material and modeling of spider man himself are far superior to other characters in the game, but the quality of the game has always been declining Lu, and even the average score of the game in spider man 3 failed. The reason is that the process of the game is still very short and the content of the game is very scarce, even if there is content other than the movie to supplement, and the price is the same as that of a group of 3A works at that time.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The rise and fall of 37 years, the first brother of Marvel spider man's turnaround in the game world/121fc5d0ddcd4d9b97c469370872bb14.jpg" alt="The rise and fall of 37 years, the first brother of Marvel spider man&#39;s turnaround in the game world"><br>PS3 Spider Man 3</p>
<p>#Beyond the shackles<br>In addition to the film adaptation, “Spider Man” this gold medal IP can’t be put on this way naturally, but also should be released from time to time from the film to save the reputation. In the gap between “Spider Man 2” and “Spider Man 3”, Activision has launched a unique work called “ultimate Spider Man”. This work adopts the style of “three shading two”. Whether it’s dialogue, plot or even battle, it’s full of the feeling of comics. What’s more, this work adopts the setting of two protagonists, and sometimes it can operate spider man to do justice, From time to time, the venom, the enemy who can control Spiderman, destroys the game, and there are many hero characters from other Marvel works in the game. The game is very interesting and solid no matter how it is handled or the content of the game. It’s hard for many players to forget after playing it once. As an experimental work, it’s really surprising.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The rise and fall of 37 years, the first brother of Marvel spider man's turnaround in the game world/592d7e2c9e6e44c9a043229ec8823f49.jpg" alt="The rise and fall of 37 years, the first brother of Marvel spider man&#39;s turnaround in the game world"><br>PS2 the ultimate spider man<br>In “the ultimate Spider Man”, Activision has added many bold attempts in the game, such as multi protagonist, open world, new swing and climbing action system. After experiencing the small success of this work, Activision is more confident in later works. Spiderman: the web of shadows in 2008 has the most excellent and powerful open world series so far. Although the plot is a little dark and a little out of the style of Spiderman, this work has been praised by many players and media by accident. Two years later, Spiderman: the dimension of fragmentation is to use a slight caricature style to render the setting of multiple protagonists again to control multiple different times The empty spider man fights in different worlds, and the fighting styles of different characters are quite different, which makes the players fully overcome the addiction of being a superhero. It’s not hard to see that the foundation of “the ultimate Spider Man” for its follow-up works is indeed a great achievement.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The rise and fall of 37 years, the first brother of Marvel spider man's turnaround in the game world/14d74b6530c84eb887f2445c707d1443.jpg" alt="The rise and fall of 37 years, the first brother of Marvel spider man&#39;s turnaround in the game world"><br>PS3 spider man: the dimension of fragmentation</p>
<h1 id="end"><a href="#end" class="headerlink" title="end"></a>end</h1><p><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The rise and fall of 37 years, the first brother of Marvel spider man's turnaround in the game world/dae414048f6d4d20a05a4f80512e2857.jpg" alt="The rise and fall of 37 years, the first brother of Marvel spider man&#39;s turnaround in the game world"><br>Since then, there has never been a satisfying spider man game. Even after Sony restart the movie “extraordinary Spider Man” and let Activision make the adapted game. Although it has achieved unprecedented cheerfulness in terms of screen, expression and fluency, it is still full of the consistent characteristics of the adapted game: sacrifice content to cater to the movie. And the sequel “time and space edge” of “broken dimension” a year later has also been criticized by the players for its lack of sincerity, just like a skin changing game with poor quality. In this way, we didn’t see the completely new marvel spider man until 2018. Although it’s still a classic formula of open world plus linear tasks, it’s definitely the best superhero work in recent years in terms of game experience and performance. As for this IP, it seems that it is also in Sony’s hands. As for the future performance of this series, please wait and see.</p>

    <title>The balancer of entertainment and hard core, where is the future of tactical shooting game</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/The%20balancer%20of%20entertainment%20and%20hard%20core,%20where%20is%20the%20future%20of%20tactical%20shooting%20game/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Shooting games have always been very popular with male players. Although they may not be as popular as MoBa in today’s electric game field, they have a wide range of styles and a large number of people in each type. Together, they can definitely surpass MoBa. With the development of time, shooting game is no longer the same as in the early years, as long as there is no brain to see the enemy to shoot, players’ tastes gradually become tricky, too casual and uninteresting, too hard core to start with is too difficult and not fun, and what is more appetizing to people is often the existence between the two, and this type of shooting game we usually call “tactical shooting” Games.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The balancer of entertainment and hard core, where is the future of tactical shooting game/8f97a64f65db4b8cace25c0f1f81dc4f.jpg" alt="The balancer of entertainment and hard core, where is the future of tactical shooting game"><br>Compared with the traditional competitive games, tactical shooting games usually emphasize the cooperation between team members, shooting is not the most critical factor to determine the outcome, the division of labor between members and the use of props are more important, the use of tactics and the use of temporary decisions can turn to win most of the time. Because of the variety of playing methods of tactical shooting games, the mechanism of operation and system should be more complex. If you want to play well, you can’t spend a lot of time to practice and get familiar with it.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The balancer of entertainment and hard core, where is the future of tactical shooting game/ec38eccc182d4517bf88b648e09bb10b.jpg" alt="The balancer of entertainment and hard core, where is the future of tactical shooting game"></p>
<p>#The originator of the mountain<br>Now when it comes to tactical shooting games, many people think of the popular Rainbow Six: siege, Rebellion: Desert Storm and other works at the first time. Considering that the historical year of color six: siege is the most senior and popular among many works, many people will directly equate color six: Siege with tactical shooting games, or even straight Then Rainbow Six as the open source of tactical shooting game. In fact, the rainbow six series does have a lot to do with the shaping of this game category, but its concept has been born a long time ago: as early as the 1980s, micro prose, a game company founded by gold medal game producer Sid Meyer and former Air Force pilot Billy stilly, was an unknown gamer before making the civilization of SID Meyer The studio is a professional in military simulation. Influenced by the avid pilot, most of the company’s games at first focused on simulation flight, and then gradually derived the branch works of ground war and individual combat.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The balancer of entertainment and hard core, where is the future of tactical shooting game/f9c03cfc20e940d2ae2ca305a81aa28b.jpg" alt="The balancer of entertainment and hard core, where is the future of tactical shooting game"><br>Microprose works<br>In 1987, Microprose launched a shooting game called “airborne Ranger”. In order to restore the difficulty of airborne combat, players should be prepared in advance before the battle begins. At the same time, players can only carry a limited amount of ammunition, so how to manage ammunition reasonably Finishing the task by the way is the biggest challenge of the game. Before that, the shooting games were always like “soul battle” or “red fortress”, which only need to see people to open fire, without brain outburst to solve the battle. There are few games that need to control the amount of ammunition, while the games like “airborne commando” that need to be carefully calculated are definitely the first time. Although the game itself is not very good, but its concept is very novel for several other game manufacturers to provide a new inspiration.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The balancer of entertainment and hard core, where is the future of tactical shooting game/5f31abc01086433d9db199e2e8cfa01e.jpg" alt="The balancer of entertainment and hard core, where is the future of tactical shooting game"><br>1987 airborne Commando</p>
<p>#All flowers bloom<br>In 1998, time has come to the trend of 3D video games. Red strom entertainment, founded by Tom Clancy, a famous military novelist, launched a counter-terrorism simulation shooting game to restore the special forces to save hostages. This game is the first generation of rainbow six. In this work, the task is not something that can be completed by one person. As the team leader of the anti-terrorism team, players need to plan the action route and order of each team member before performing each task, and assign corresponding equipment to them. Because the death of the players is permanent, the process of the game is usually half an hour of tactical arrangement and only five minutes of fighting. Only constant trial and error can ensure that the players can successfully complete the task in a relatively safe situation.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The balancer of entertainment and hard core, where is the future of tactical shooting game/cfc348e0af594511b49201bd9a4c0227.jpg" alt="The balancer of entertainment and hard core, where is the future of tactical shooting game"><br>1998 Rainbow Six<br>The first work of rainbow six has achieved a very good reputation and evaluation. However, due to its overall high difficulty and relatively hard playing method, which tests the patience and logical thinking of the players, the sales volume of the game can only be called fair, but it also meets the small needs of some good military lovers. Because of its strict hard core setting, and the self positioning of the work given by its own card, it is “tactical shooting game”. Since then, the concept of “tactical shooting game” has always followed Rainbow Six, becoming its core design concept. With rainbow six perfecting the game type of “both hard and soft”, other types of anti-terrorism tactical shooting games have begun to appear on the market, such as delta Special Forces, which was popular in Chinese Internet cafes in the north and south of the Yangtze River in the early years, SWAT (thunderbolt team), even anti-terrorism elites (though they are the easiest to start with) It was born in such a big environment.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The balancer of entertainment and hard core, where is the future of tactical shooting game/e62b17503aad493ab60e62ca0d091dfc.jpg" alt="The balancer of entertainment and hard core, where is the future of tactical shooting game"><br>Swat3, which was transformed into action shooting game in 1999</p>
<h1 id="last-survivor"><a href="#last-survivor" class="headerlink" title="last survivor"></a>last survivor</h1><p>With the development of time and the accumulation of time, as well as the cooperation between Tom Clancy and Ubisoft, it seems that all the heat of “tactical shooting game” has been dominated by Ubisoft for a while. There are not only rainbow six in the first person, but also operation ghost in the third person. Although the series of “SWAT” by Sierra is based on The old sequel is being launched, but the heat has never been able to compete with Ubisoft. As for delta Special Forces on the other side, it has started its endless self abandonment. The problems of the game itself are not repaired, and the development technology is always backward, which can be said to be a real gnawing at the old book. At the same time, the only popular one is anti terrorist elite, because of its low threshold and The main way to play the multi player game makes it more inclined to competitive shooting games, so it has become a competitive FPS game with only a few elements of “tactical shooting game”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The balancer of entertainment and hard core, where is the future of tactical shooting game/d5e769cbea644d8bbd82aab550cbd472.jpg" alt="The balancer of entertainment and hard core, where is the future of tactical shooting game"><br>1999 counter terrorism elite<br>Today, even “anti terrorist elite” has experienced two sequels, and now it has become the most popular FPS competitive game in the world. Rainbow Six has also changed from the original hard core single player game to the antagonistic tactical shooting game, from the original “solo music” to “fighting with people for fun”. Although there are some twists and turns in the transformation process But it has achieved good results in the end, and now it has become “the most fun FPS competitive game”. The rumor that “SWAT” will launch a new work has been circulating throughout the game circle, but as for when it will be released, it is unknown. In the near future, there will be a hard core tactical shooting game called “ready or not”. This game was once regarded as the spiritual sequel of “SWAT”. It has been greatly improved both in the picture and in the playing method. It is very expected to watch the game demonstration alone.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The balancer of entertainment and hard core, where is the future of tactical shooting game/b7619f98336d44b69b4d1a62df843b71.jpg" alt="The balancer of entertainment and hard core, where is the future of tactical shooting game"><br>    concluding remarks<br>Thanks to several “old masters”, the excellent game mode of “tactical shooting” has been recognized and accepted by more players, and has always been active in the front-line field. Maybe this is the attitude that an excellent game type should have. Maybe in the future, we can see that tactical shooting games can evolve again on the basis of existing ones, but this is another story.</p>

    <title>The renewal of the spirit of arcade, SNK&#39;s new Neo Pro rocker integrated host hardware evaluation</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/The%20renewal%20of%20the%20spirit%20of%20arcade,%20SNK&#39;s%20new%20Neo%20Pro%20rocker%20integrated%20host%20hardware%20evaluation/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to the most popular fighting games nowadays, it’s not “Nintendo star fighting”. On November 7, the NS platform “Nintendo star fighting special edition” broke the record set by all fighting games with 15.7 million sales, becoming the best-selling fighting game in history. At the same time, the “fighting” also released its latest DLC characters: from SNK classic fighting games Terry, the popular character in the legend of the hungry wolf. Terry not only has a very high degree of reduction or even better character modeling, and even all of its representative moves are also included, but it is worth mentioning that the character also retains the original instructions in the arcade game in terms of operation. Although this operation mode is different from the previous operation mode of “big fight”, it has the characteristics of arcade operation.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The renewal of the spirit of arcade, SNK's new Neo Pro rocker integrated host hardware evaluation/fbee1236b5d7476badb92b63c0e3f600.jpg" alt="The renewal of the spirit of arcade, SNK&#39;s new Neo Pro rocker integrated host hardware evaluation"><br>Terry’s role not only appeared in the legend of hungry wolves, but also in the classic fighting game boxer. In the early years, SNK, the developer of these games, was a major representative of arcade games. In that era when arcade games were popular in the world, not everyone wanted to go to the noisy Arcade hall to play games, and a considerable number of players preferred it Huan playing games at home, not only can have a quieter environment, but also can practice operation at will without any scruples.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The renewal of the spirit of arcade, SNK's new Neo Pro rocker integrated host hardware evaluation/b15bdba6579e476d8c5ba12cd50f56f8.jpg" alt="The renewal of the spirit of arcade, SNK&#39;s new Neo Pro rocker integrated host hardware evaluation"><br>At that time, if you want to play arcade fighting games at home, such as “Street Fighter” and “real fight”, you only need to buy a Nintendo SFC and bring a game with you. If you want to play SNK games such as “Boxer” and “soul service”, only its official NEOGEO host is the best experience choice. The author is lucky to get the qualification to experience SNK’s latest NEOGEO arcade stick pro (ASP for short). The following is a comprehensive evaluation of this latest product.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The renewal of the spirit of arcade, SNK's new Neo Pro rocker integrated host hardware evaluation/50e9e7d1ba294f15b9a9a1637605c145.jpg" alt="The renewal of the spirit of arcade, SNK&#39;s new Neo Pro rocker integrated host hardware evaluation"></p>

According to the current information, it seems that this ASP host only has a white version, with the specification of 428.9  214.2  124mm. It is about the same size as a standard keyboard, but it is much more prominent in height. The host weighs 2.56kg, which is not much worse than a real game host. It can be said that it is full of weight. If it is placed on the desktop, it will have a very heavy feeling, which can also meet the habit of some players like to play with the rocker on their legs. The overall shape of the host seems to pay homage to the NEOGEO CD handle produced by SNK in the early stage, but it is much larger than the handle, and its color matching and the font sprayed on the body are consistent with the CD handle.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The renewal of the spirit of arcade, SNK's new Neo Pro rocker integrated host hardware evaluation/4350c8acc5574370b983255c9f30fb43.jpg" alt="The renewal of the spirit of arcade, SNK&#39;s new Neo Pro rocker integrated host hardware evaluation"><br>The front end of the host is equipped with two type-C interfaces for external connection of additional NEOGEO handle and a 3.5mm headphone hole, while the back end is equipped with a type-C input interface for connection of power cable, an HDMI interface for output image and a USB interface. The maximum output resolution of the host mode is 720p, and USB can be used to update the host system with external devices and control peripherals with other USB ports.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The renewal of the spirit of arcade, SNK's new Neo Pro rocker integrated host hardware evaluation/7ed064b6351a41548b2c9e92734df427.jpg" alt="The renewal of the spirit of arcade, SNK&#39;s new Neo Pro rocker integrated host hardware evaluation"><br>There are four function buttons and two mode switch on the right side of the host, which are designed to avoid accidental contact during use. From left to right, there are consecutive keys, option keys, and more common selection keys and start keys on the game handle. The two mode switches are mode switch (○ rocker mode / ● host mode), and applicable platform switch to prevent conflict when multiple devices are connected to the same terminal.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The renewal of the spirit of arcade, SNK's new Neo Pro rocker integrated host hardware evaluation/6d11fb9011bd46439805399b6064eada.jpg" alt="The renewal of the spirit of arcade, SNK&#39;s new Neo Pro rocker integrated host hardware evaluation"><br>There is a connecting line at the bottom of the left side of the host used to connect the host as a controller with other terminals. The connecting line is directly stored in the host body and cannot be removed directly. The hole position on the cover of the storage box can easily lead out the line without worrying about the problem of the line being pinched. At the same time, the cover of the storage box is thick and firm. As long as it is not too hard, it should not be easy to get out There is damage. The connecting line is two meters long, which belongs to the standard specification of general wired peripherals. However, because it is located on the left side of the host, some people may not adapt to it.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The renewal of the spirit of arcade, SNK's new Neo Pro rocker integrated host hardware evaluation/2f923f9be23247d19355ced1ca390d08.jpg" alt="The renewal of the spirit of arcade, SNK&#39;s new Neo Pro rocker integrated host hardware evaluation"><br>In terms of rocker, the ball head adopts a polished ball head with the same specification as the streetcar. When controlling the rocker, you can intuitively feel the square gear in four directions and the crisp four small directions. When using, you can easily feel the direction of the rocker and the input of instructions. A ball head replacement auxiliary hole is attached on the back of the host and just below the rocker. Players can use the tool to easily remove the rocker and screw off the ball head for replacement.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The renewal of the spirit of arcade, SNK's new Neo Pro rocker integrated host hardware evaluation/18180e309df343b2ac0a74b072690c92.jpg" alt="The renewal of the spirit of arcade, SNK&#39;s new Neo Pro rocker integrated host hardware evaluation"><br>The common eight key layout is adopted on the surface of the host computer. The game under SNK basically only needs four keys to operate, and the eight key layout can adapt to more games and games such as street fighter, which can use eight keys. The key program of the key belongs to medium, and the key is soft compared with the specifications of the arcade, so it doesn’t need too much force to respond to the key, but the key layout of the eight key is not compact, and the player with small hands may feel that he can’t press it too much when operating, so he needs to adjust his habitual key layout in advance before the game starts. It is worth mentioning that the surface of the host computer and all buttons are made of fine matte material, so players can not worry about the sweaty palms that will cause the operation panel surface to become oily and slippery and affect the feel.</p>

This does not exclude that in the future, the official will lift the ban or update the game in some ways,   the specific information should be subject to the official information  . It is also worth mentioning that in the host mode, if you want to connect the TV or monitor, you need to provide your own HDMI cable.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The renewal of the spirit of arcade, SNK's new Neo Pro rocker integrated host hardware evaluation/bcf0d55664144a39a557a97aeb3c5a02.jpg" alt="The renewal of the spirit of arcade, SNK&#39;s new Neo Pro rocker integrated host hardware evaluation"><br>20 original games that should have been included<br>To sum up, at present, we can only use the rocker mode temporarily. When it is used in the rocker mode, its operation principle is basically the same as the general game controller peripherals, and it can adapt to all game types and platforms that support the controller control, and it will be automatically adapted to Xbox 360. At present, several popular arcade simulators, ASP, can directly adapt to the network, but it requires players to use ASP to change the key mapping in the simulator settings. For some simulators that can’t adapt to the Xbox 360 handle, some keys may not be mapped. At this time, players need to switch the ASP mode by pressing the options key on the side of the host, so that they can be used normally even in older simulators. At the same time, by connecting the attached adapter, the USB connector can be converted into type-C interface, and the mobile device with type-C interface can also be connected, and it can also be applied to the simulator of mobile terminal.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The renewal of the spirit of arcade, SNK's new Neo Pro rocker integrated host hardware evaluation/4029001c617f43c8a59ce7e3ca0c65fd.jpg" alt="The renewal of the spirit of arcade, SNK&#39;s new Neo Pro rocker integrated host hardware evaluation"><br>Simple setup of WinKawaks simulator<br>Due to the limitation of platform hardware, ASP can not be directly connected to the home host (PS, NS, etc.) as a peripheral at present, so it needs to be connected through a special converter. In the PC version of the game, most of the fighting games will support the original direct connection adaptation (iron fist, boxer, street bully, etc.), after all, these games themselves support the use of rockers for control.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The renewal of the spirit of arcade, SNK's new Neo Pro rocker integrated host hardware evaluation/5a039addc7b941369a73d2dfe73460be.jpg" alt="The renewal of the spirit of arcade, SNK&#39;s new Neo Pro rocker integrated host hardware evaluation"><br>Easy adaptation to boxer 14<br>If ASP is used in other third-party games of non combat games, most of the Games will automatically adapt it to Xbox 360 handle. Although it can be controlled, most of the games that support handle operation do not have the settings to change the key layout. Therefore, the author suggests that if ASP is used to play other games, it is better to play the horizontal action games with relatively simple system , and other types of game control can make you miserable and suspicious.<br>    concluding remarks<br>At present, NEOGEO arcade Stick Pro is accepting the agreement, and the price of Bank of China 899 is the lowest in the world. If it is only used as a rocker peripheral, it also belongs to a mid-range price, with strong adaptability, it is worth recommending. Online circulation can be achieved through the use of external forces to lift the ban on the built-in games of the host, but the author does not advocate this kind of behavior very much. After cracking, the machine will lose the right of three guarantees. If there is a problem with the machine, it will be more difficult to deal with it.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The renewal of the spirit of arcade, SNK's new Neo Pro rocker integrated host hardware evaluation/301cc94161784ef99a570e17d668e058.jpg" alt="The renewal of the spirit of arcade, SNK&#39;s new Neo Pro rocker integrated host hardware evaluation"><br>In a blink of an eye, NEOGEO has been born for nearly 28 years, but until now, we still don’t forget the well-known role images in “Boxer” and “soul service”. Nintendo even included them in “big fight”. It can be seen that its position in the field of games is high. If we can’t forget the time when we were young when we were burning our youth in the arcade hall, It is a good choice to keep it as a treasure.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>Speaking of the famous line “everything is empty and everything is allowed”, we all know that it comes from the assassin’s Creed. This line has been implemented from the early works of the series to today, and has always been the core values in the series of Assassin’s Creed. The assassin’s creed is so popular that I don’t need to introduce it too much. No matter boys or girls, they can’t forget the iconic hood and “leap of faith”. Assassin’s creed is not only a series of games, but also a kind of culture. It’s a kind of spirit of fearless desire for freedom. Its influence is so great that the developer Ubisoft treats it as a son, and it’s also a series with the most works under Ubisoft.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The prince of Persia, the prince who never sees the sun, is scattered in the yellow sand under the edge of his sword/639cf8ef1b1c412290ed265d845e13cc.jpg" alt="The prince of Persia, the prince who never sees the sun, is scattered in the yellow sand under the edge of his sword"><br>The success of Assassin’s Creed series today is mainly due to its solid game quality, but few people know that the birth of Assassin’s creed is due to a famous character of Ubisoft many years ago. He’s a prince, but he doesn’t like fishing, bird racing and barbecue; he’s also as light as a swallow, but he can’t touch the light of the white robe. The people gradually forget his appearance, but they will never forget his name. He is Prince of Persia.</p>
<h1 id="NEW"><a href="#NEW" class="headerlink" title="NEW"></a>NEW</h1><p>The story about the prince dates back to a college student named Jordan McKenna in the 1980s. The aspiring young man has a strong interest in electronic computers since high school. From the age of 15, he has devoted all his spare time to the “Apple II” computer, and occasionally wrote a few small games when he was free. At the age of 20, in order to ease the economic situation of his family and himself, he decided to make a game with a commercial nature in exchange for living expenses. His first known work is karateka.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The prince of Persia, the prince who never sees the sun, is scattered in the yellow sand under the edge of his sword/66583548feab40b5b6fa67c21953a9aa.jpg" alt="The prince of Persia, the prince who never sees the sun, is scattered in the yellow sand under the edge of his sword"><br>Karate game screen<br>This is a common horizontal action clearance game. The game’s playing method is nothing more than to control a karate master to kill demons and eliminate demons and defeat demons to save the princess. However, due to the detailed and smooth character action performance in the game, it has attracted many people’s attention. With the help of the publisher Broderbund, the game became the best-selling Apple II computer platform at that time One of the game works, with a sales volume of 500000 copies, also made McKenna the first pot of gold in his life. In view of the success of karate, Broderbund, the publisher, also took a fancy to the young man’s technical ability, so he had the idea of bringing it into his hands to produce a new work, which was also welcomed by McKenna. But what kind of game to make this time is not up to him. The developer only gave him a few pieces of information, and the story background had to be Arabic style The main character is Baghdad (Persian “God’s gift”).<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The prince of Persia, the prince who never sees the sun, is scattered in the yellow sand under the edge of his sword/2fa8072ffa42427e917edd8af6b45053.jpg" alt="The prince of Persia, the prince who never sees the sun, is scattered in the yellow sand under the edge of his sword"><br>FC Prince of persia game screen</p>
<h1 id="peak"><a href="#peak" class="headerlink" title="peak"></a>peak</h1><p>McKenna’s strength lies in the meticulous production of characters’ movements. This time, he wanted to go further on the original basis, so he adopted the shooting method of “transfer tracing machine”, which was quite popular in the animation industry at that time. You can understand that this is the earliest motion capture technology. Its principle is to use the camera to capture the actor’s actions, and then the animator will describe the characters’ actions frame by frame to form an animation, and then scan the animation into the program. The advantage is that the action of the characters in the game can be as smooth as the movie, and the fluency of the new work of McKenna in the game industry at that time can’t be matched. And the game itself is also a horizontal action clearance game. The plot of the game is deeper and more complex than karate, but the same is the classic formula of hero saving beauty. The protagonist has also changed from karate master to the young prince of Persia (although the thief pretends to be the Prince), so just like the previous one, the game is directly called Prince of Persia.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The prince of Persia, the prince who never sees the sun, is scattered in the yellow sand under the edge of his sword/b200027492464bd6aff36c37006cb1c7.jpg" alt="The prince of Persia, the prince who never sees the sun, is scattered in the yellow sand under the edge of his sword"><br>Prince of persia game cover<br>After all, the game adopted the concept of leading industry at that time, so the development cycle of the game is also getting longer and longer. After all, it took four years to complete the game and it went public in 1989. With the fame of the previous work, the work also attracted the attention of many players before it was released. With excellent quality and interesting level, it quickly became a hit. It logged into about seven different platforms at that time and successfully achieved 2 million sales. With such achievements, the sequel has become a sure thing. Prince of Persia 2: Shadow and flame was released in 1993. It continues the story of the previous work, but also greatly strengthens the screen again. The overall game flow is several times of that of the previous work. Unfortunately, this work does not reproduce the glory of the previous work. The sales volume is slightly lower than that of the previous generation, but it is still a good quality one Masterpiece.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The prince of Persia, the prince who never sees the sun, is scattered in the yellow sand under the edge of his sword/ce8683b806cf414184ad1a85090cfeac.jpg" alt="The prince of Persia, the prince who never sees the sun, is scattered in the yellow sand under the edge of his sword"><br>Prince of Persia 2: Shadow and fire</p>
<h1 id="bungee-jumping"><a href="#bungee-jumping" class="headerlink" title="bungee jumping"></a>bungee jumping</h1><p>However, McKenna’s brilliant career has not been sustained. With the passage of time, the game has also come to the 3D era from the 2D era. For a long time, almost all the world is doing 3D games, whether real 3D or Pseudo 3D, as long as it is 3D. Players who have played the game for a certain period of time should not be unfamiliar with the Tomb Raider in the early years. Laura Crawford, the protagonist in the game, can make all kinds of magnificent and practical climbing, rolling, jumping and other actions to cross all kinds of dangerous situations. The excellent level design and new 3D playing methods make this sexy female Explorer a hot big one in the circle and out of the circle in an instant The main reason for the characters is that there were almost no female protagonists at that time, and Laura was undoubtedly the most successful one.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The prince of Persia, the prince who never sees the sun, is scattered in the yellow sand under the edge of his sword/a86193ae20bc47e08adf77a8bb5c4a0b.jpg" alt="The prince of Persia, the prince who never sees the sun, is scattered in the yellow sand under the edge of his sword"><br>This can make the prince of the other country suffer. Since I have 3D, I also have 3D, so Prince of Persia 3D came into being. This work can be said to be the biggest one invested by the developer Broderbund. After all, making 3D at that time was almost equal to burning money. If the game is not well bought, it may directly lead to the company’s violent death. However, the consistent smooth action of Prince of Persia series has not been shown again in the full 3D picture. The overall playing method of the game is almost the same as that of Tomb Raider. The biggest difference is that the protagonist uses a knife rather than a gun.<br>Because it’s the first attempt, there are many problems in game optimization and bug, so the experience of the game is a little bit bad. Fortunately, the game is still interesting from an objective point of view. It’s not a good work, but it’s not a dung work. After the baptism of Tomb Raider, most of the players’ feelings about the game are “lack of sincerity”, “changing skin” “Game” and so on, so the sales volume of the game is certainly huge, and the stock price of the learning company, the parent company of the publisher Broderbund, has also been falling all the way, almost reaching the level of being unable to make ends meet.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The prince of Persia, the prince who never sees the sun, is scattered in the yellow sand under the edge of his sword/2c46755672bf49e8a93d03c7b1930c50.jpg" alt="The prince of Persia, the prince who never sees the sun, is scattered in the yellow sand under the edge of his sword"><br>Prince of Persia 3D game screen<br>Helpless, the company is worth selling IP everywhere to find a thigh hug, or it will really go bankrupt. In this environment, it is no longer necessary for McKenna to stay in the company, so he left the company and chose to engage in film production. In such a situation, Prince of Persia is valued by Ubisoft from France. It plans to take this IP first. Naturally, the learning company readily agrees, “give it as long as you pay.”. In this way, the distribution right of Prince of Persia has been handed over to Ubisoft, but they have no right to make games even though they have IP. The reason is that half of the IP copyright of Prince of Persia is in the hands of the original author, michina. If they want to make games, they have to nod their heads.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The prince of Persia, the prince who never sees the sun, is scattered in the yellow sand under the edge of his sword/b44c8a30ec184780bb00ca127f056ffb.jpg" alt="The prince of Persia, the prince who never sees the sun, is scattered in the yellow sand under the edge of his sword"><br>Jordan Mechner<br>Taking advantage of this IP and to express sincerity, Ubisoft team first made a demo for Prince of Persia. In this demo, the Prince changed the slow and slow action in the previous 3D version, and mastered the local “local specialty” Parkour ability. No matter running, jumping, rolling and climbing, it has unprecedented consistency and fluency, which perfectly solved the previous work All the problems that have occurred. Obviously, the team who made this demo is a real fan of this series. With this demo Ubisoft, he found McKenna. McKenna said, “this is the effect he has always wanted to create.” so he accepted Ubisoft’s authorization request and was willing to participate in the development of the game together to ensure the “original” of the work.</p>
<h1 id="sacrifice-to-the-prince-and-become-an-assassin"><a href="#sacrifice-to-the-prince-and-become-an-assassin" class="headerlink" title="sacrifice to the prince and become an assassin"></a>sacrifice to the prince and become an assassin</h1><p>Ubisoft has broken its heart for this new work to express its love for this series. It has a new 3D engine, a seamless map, a smooth character movement and a “blade of time” system that can trace back time. In 2003, the series restart work “Prince of Persia: sand of time” appeared in the players’ field of vision. Relying on those novel settings and performances mentioned above, it has once again earned the players’ attention, making many old players who initially did not look forward to the series again full of hope. The final performance of the game is also true. The final sales volume of the whole platform of the game reached 14 million sets. As of 2005, there were 2 million sets of sales, which not only reappeared the glory of Prince of Persia, but also directly surpassed the former. The players can’t help but sigh: “prince he is alive!” And Ubisoft itself also relies on the success of this work to change from a first-class game studio to a 3A game developer.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The prince of Persia, the prince who never sees the sun, is scattered in the yellow sand under the edge of his sword/4e9c5ac0bc2945dc8430491aa880866f.jpg" alt="The prince of Persia, the prince who never sees the sun, is scattered in the yellow sand under the edge of his sword"><br>Prince of Persia: sand of time<br>In the following two years, Ubisoft successively launched Prince of Persia 2: the heart of the warrior and Prince of Persia 3: the king is matchless, which is regarded as a trilogy after a series of resurrection. Among them, the king is matchless is a masterpiece of a series. The newly added assassination system also corrects the overall rhythm of the game, which provides a stage for the whole “sand of time” trilogy Perfect period, considering that the development cycle of each work is only one year, this undoubtedly makes Ubisoft earn a lot of money. And how can such a golden IP be put in such a white place? They also began to plan the next series of development of Prince of Persia. They plan to restart the series twice, and at the same time, they hope to present the story of Prince of Persia in a different perspective. In this perspective, Ubisoft plans to put it on the assassin who protects the prince. So Prince of Persia: Assassin begins to enter the development stage, and the open world Prince of Persia, which focuses on the next generation of mainframe at the same time, is also put on the agenda.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The prince of Persia, the prince who never sees the sun, is scattered in the yellow sand under the edge of his sword/c561ffc959f24410b503251af463c489.jpg" alt="The prince of Persia, the prince who never sees the sun, is scattered in the yellow sand under the edge of his sword"><br>Prince of Persia 3: the king is unparalleled<br>As a result, Ubisoft found that they wanted to add more and more elements to the book Prince of Persia: assassin and build a larger world outlook, so they made a very risky decision: to separate this work from the frame of Prince of Persia as an individual series, to abandon the setting of Prince of Persia and start a new system Do. So in 2007, the derivative game “Assassin’s Creed”, which was made by yubidang as a water trial work, went on sale. Meanwhile, the new prince of Persia is still in the process of production. But it never occurred to me that this water trial product, because of its cool and cool game style and more popular settings, made the game more popular than ever. It set a sales record of Ubisoft for many years, and sold 10 million copies in one year, faster than any previous product of Ubisoft. This sudden success also caught Ubisoft by surprise.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The prince of Persia, the prince who never sees the sun, is scattered in the yellow sand under the edge of his sword/c039691fe2a641d5b99197287986a2f7.jpg" alt="The prince of Persia, the prince who never sees the sun, is scattered in the yellow sand under the edge of his sword"><br>Assassin’s Creed</p>
<h1 id="end"><a href="#end" class="headerlink" title="end"></a>end</h1><p>A year later, the new prince of Persia (also known as Prince of Persia 4), whose painting style changed greatly, sold well, but it was still dwarfed by the sales volume of 10 million set by the assassin’s Creed. The obvious sales comparison also made Ubisoft realize the difference between the two. It seems that the era of Prince of Persia has passed. After all, they invested a lot of manpower and material resources in Prince of Persia, but it is far less direct than a new IP. Obviously, the status of Assassin’s Creed surpassed Prince of Persia in an instant, as if they had already There is no reason to make a new book for Prince of Persia. In order to give the fans an account, in 2010 Ubisoft launched the last “Prince of Persia” work “the sand of forgetting”, which is the end of the series.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The prince of Persia, the prince who never sees the sun, is scattered in the yellow sand under the edge of his sword/6ce9e61546464da89e6130396844bdd9.jpg" alt="The prince of Persia, the prince who never sees the sun, is scattered in the yellow sand under the edge of his sword"><br>Prince of Persia<br>At the beginning of 2013, Ubisoft officially announced to suspend the follow-up production of Prince of Persia series works, and when to come up with ideas suitable for the new works before considering the development. It has been more than six years since now, and even cell division, which has been sealed for many years, has confirmed that it is about to launch a sequel. However, the fans’ voice for the new work Prince of Persia is so high that no news of the new work flows out. In my opinion, in fact, we can be optimistic. After all, we can’t say too much. Maybe when the time is right, Ubisoft will try again.</p>

    <title>The trump card of being shut down, the rise and fall of visceral games, the developer of dead space</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/The%20trump%20card%20of%20being%20shut%20down,%20the%20rise%20and%20fall%20of%20visceral%20games,%20the%20developer%20of%20dead%20space/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>On October 18, 2017, a studio named visceral game was closed. It’s no surprise that the game studio was closed in the game circle. But if the company that closed it is the EA known as “studio killer”, the event itself will be added with a layer of debuff with the effect of “ridicule”, which will not only attract the players’ anger and abuse At the same time, we will be more sorry for this unfortunate studio. If this studio can be opened to the present, it should have a history of 21 years. You may not think of any works of this name alone, but when it comes to the dead space series, you may have a big idea.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The trump card of being shut down, the rise and fall of visceral games, the developer of dead space/1e655bceee704faebbceeff0cc5551af.jpg" alt="The trump card of being shut down, the rise and fall of visceral games, the developer of dead space"><br>When it comes to “dead space”, until this is a third person shooting horror game, many players can’t help shivering just watching the bloody and dark scenes and strange looking monsters in the screenshots of the game. There is such a thing between players that can reach a consensus: if the protagonist of the horror game is equipped with weapons, the horror level of the game will be reduced to a lot, or even to almost none, but the “dead space” with shooting as the core method of play has not been reduced in the construction of the horror atmosphere, which is enough to prove its quality is excellent, and the more people think it is excellent Xiu, more and more people feel sorry for its absence.</p>
<h1 id="adapted-game-owner"><a href="#adapted-game-owner" class="headerlink" title="adapted game owner"></a>adapted game owner</h1><p>Visceral Games was founded in 1998. It was originally called “Redwood Shores” because it is located in the Redwood City of San Francisco Bay area, California. For some reason, the unknown small studio attracted the attention of EA, which is also located in Redwood City. Nick earl, former senior vice president of EA, proposed to the senior management that they should buy the studio. The reason for this is that the two founders of the studio, Michael kantley and Glenn Scofield, have a different temperament 。 This kind of metaphysical reason can’t be accepted by any Chinese. After all, the acquisition is not a trivial matter. After all, Nick’s position is here. At the same time, he is constantly encouraging. EA finally can’t help but agree to Nick’s request, and the studio is renamed “EA Redwood sea shore studio”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The trump card of being shut down, the rise and fall of visceral games, the developer of dead space/1cd665b430514490a4e3c2849d3b3332.jpg" alt="The trump card of being shut down, the rise and fall of visceral games, the developer of dead space"><br>Glenn Scofield on the left and Michael kantley on the right<br>It turns out that Nick’s vision is right. In the next eight years after joining EA in 2001, mahogany coast was mainly responsible for the production of EA’s IP adaptation games, such as 007 series, godfather series and Lord of the rings series. They were responsible for a total of 10 works. From an objective point of view, although the quality of these games can not be said to be excellent, they can definitely meet the expectations of film fans, especially the godfather series and the original film even form a complementary relationship. It can be said that EA with the mahogany coast has created a golden age of “film and game linkage” in the field of video games.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The trump card of being shut down, the rise and fall of visceral games, the developer of dead space/5bb75319f83f4c898a58edc0ad19a4be.jpg" alt="The trump card of being shut down, the rise and fall of visceral games, the developer of dead space"><br>In the 2003 game “007: who is competing with the front”, the recovery degree of the character appearance is very high</p>
<h1 id="free-from-bondage"><a href="#free-from-bondage" class="headerlink" title="free from bondage"></a>free from bondage</h1><p>As two ideal game producers, it’s definitely not Michael and Glen’s life to adapt the game according to their boss’s requirements all day long, which makes them have the intention to leave EA. Meanwhile, the next door movietv has long been interested in their ability in making games and plans to incorporate them. EA has no way. In order to retain them, it gave Redwood coast a chance to make its own original IP, which left them. According to media interviews, they were deeply influenced by the immersive RPG game “cyber Wizard” and were overwhelmed by the game atmosphere they created. At the same time, in 2004, they came into contact with the survival horror game “biochemical crisis 4”, which once reached the peak level. So they had the idea of combining the map design of “cyber Wizard” with the play method of survival terrorist shooting of “biochemical crisis 4”. In view of the great success of biochemical crisis 4 at that time, EA also affirmed their proposal and was willing to provide more resources for it.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The trump card of being shut down, the rise and fall of visceral games, the developer of dead space/6c224f628fed49bc8c65d03829197cf6.jpg" alt="The trump card of being shut down, the rise and fall of visceral games, the developer of dead space"><br>Now looking back, death space has learned a lot from biochemical crisis 4<br>This game is the first generation of “dead space” released in October 2008. No one could have imagined that the game had an unprecedented success. At the end of that year, it had a sales volume of 1 million sets, while the cumulative sales volume reached 4 million sets. As a brand-new original IP, this achievement can be said to be quite successful, which is partly due to the reputation of EA as a leading manufacturer The big reason is that the quality of the game is really excellent, and the media and players also give wide recognition to this work. Glenn and Michael’s position in the company leaped, with the noisy capital of mahogany coast, becoming the independent studio of EA directly, and also renamed as the visual games (VG for short). It is the great success of “dead space” series that has laid the main tone of the future of the studio: darkness, terror, blood and adulthood.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The trump card of being shut down, the rise and fall of visceral games, the developer of dead space/9451ddc03be9453f9ddbf7c1d1412a63.jpg" alt="The trump card of being shut down, the rise and fall of visceral games, the developer of dead space"><br>It’s depressing just to see</p>
<h1 id="the-sword-moves-on-one-side"><a href="#the-sword-moves-on-one-side" class="headerlink" title="the sword moves on one side"></a>the sword moves on one side</h1><p>However, despite the success of death space, Glenn and Michael chose to leave, joined Activision and set up hammer studio to do cod. I don’t know what they think. EA finally gave them the right to create freely, but they chose to give up, and running to Activision didn’t get the freedom they wanted. Cod: advanced war and cod: World War II, which were produced by them, didn’t get much public praise, but fortunately, the sales volume of the game was still considerable, which made them finally sit on activism The location of the layer. Looking back at VG, after the two creators left, the sequel of “dead space” must be done, but at the same time, they have to be busy living their new IP, and “Dante hell” is their answer.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The trump card of being shut down, the rise and fall of visceral games, the developer of dead space/ef7baea6836440658ec9031ceb5f6582.jpg" alt="The trump card of being shut down, the rise and fall of visceral games, the developer of dead space"><br>Modern war 3 was produced by sledgehammer studio<br>Strictly speaking, “Dante hell” is an action game with good quality, but the only disadvantage is that it is too much like the God of war. No matter the overall style or the combat system, or even the fight against the huge boss with mortal body, it is similar to “the God of war”. I don’t think it’s the God of war that made an extra chapter. The average sales volume of Dante hell is obviously not enough for EA. VG realized at this time that it’s better to be honest and give a sequel to dead space. EA still gives VG’s support at all levels without elders, hoping that they can create a miracle again.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The trump card of being shut down, the rise and fall of visceral games, the developer of dead space/f0c3d27ec9a942228a8c866df5ac0913.jpg" alt="The trump card of being shut down, the rise and fall of visceral games, the developer of dead space"><br>How similar are the colors of the game<br>“Dead space 2” was released in early 2011. Sure enough, the sales volume of the game was basically the same as that of the previous one, which is a matter of celebration, but in fact it is not. EA gave great hope to the sequel of “dead space”, provided a lot of resources for it, even in the promotion of the game, although the game sold well, the profit actually earned was far lower than EA’s plan, which disappointed EA. It’s true that the game itself has no problems, but EA’s own high expectations for dead space 2.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The trump card of being shut down, the rise and fall of visceral games, the developer of dead space/7a9dd3bb3cda4e968a904fcc3ff7be28.jpg" alt="The trump card of being shut down, the rise and fall of visceral games, the developer of dead space"><br>Although the second generation of the series is well known, not many people dare to try<br>In order to further improve the sales volume, the new work of VG plan “dead space” can adopt an open world system that is more in line with the trend of the times, and join the multi person online mode. However, for the horror game, the open world is the big taboo in the big taboo, and for the creation of the horror atmosphere, it is a devastating injury. Although the multi person online can increase the gameplay, after all, “death” Dead space has always been a single action adventure game with heavy atmosphere. The immersion of multiplayer game is definitely not as good as that of single player experience. It can be said that this time VG dug its own grave. “Dead space 3” was released in 2013. I believe that many old players have lost their desire to buy when they heard that the new work has been changed into an open world, and the final sales volume of the game is only half of that of the previous one. Such a large investment will eventually bring such a small return. In other words, everyone will be crazy, let alone EA, which has always attached great importance to benefits.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The trump card of being shut down, the rise and fall of visceral games, the developer of dead space/916c5838d0514ea6ba026383453a467f.jpg" alt="The trump card of being shut down, the rise and fall of visceral games, the developer of dead space"><br>The three generations pay more attention to fighting content, just like biochemical crisis 6, which is no longer horrible</p>
<h1 id="end-how-can-I-get-the-word-“miserable”"><a href="#end-how-can-I-get-the-word-“miserable”" class="headerlink" title="end: how can I get the word “miserable”?"></a>end: how can I get the word “miserable”?</h1><p>In short, the failure of VG is a combination of many factors. The departure of the elders has led to a great loss of vitality, a decline in the production level of original IP, and high expectations of EA. Although EA is known as the “studio killer”, this pot can’t be carried by EA alone. After all, EA has given VG too much support and expectations, and they even asked for “battlefield” from dice It’s for VG, but VG hasn’t done FPS games in his life, let alone battlefield, which is a pillar IP. The final outcome of the game is predictable.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The trump card of being shut down, the rise and fall of visceral games, the developer of dead space/133429fcbf2f44bd9585650f133bca55.jpg" alt="The trump card of being shut down, the rise and fall of visceral games, the developer of dead space"><br>Most unlike battlefield, battlefield: hard battle is their work<br>It may be that the pressure on VG is so heavy that VG can’t breathe and can’t respond to EA’s high expectations. Of course, when a studio is at its best, there is no need to exist. Players regret the closure of VG, but after all, the main purpose of the game is to make money, and hope that players can understand it. EA will hide “dead space” as an IP, but never said that it will never launch a new work from now on. I hope I can hear the new news of “dead space” again in my lifetime.</p>

    <title>Three years ago, the home-made blockbuster game came back again. What kind of game is lost castle</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/Three%20years%20ago,%20the%20home-made%20blockbuster%20game%20came%20back%20again.%20What%20kind%20of%20game%20is%20lost%20castle/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Three years ago, an independent game named “Lost Castle” appeared in steam mall, and soon attracted the attention of many players. This is a 2D cartoon style horizontal action game with rougelite (rougelite is different from rougelike) elements. With rich game content and highly playable rougelite playing method, it is also a small fire in the independent game circle. Several friends of the author were quite addicted to this game at that time, playing several online every night.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Three years ago, the home-made blockbuster game came back again. What kind of game is lost castle/d17824f4bbc3441bb2a048714eefffc1.jpg" alt="Three years ago, the home-made blockbuster game came back again. What kind of game is lost castle"><br>Lost Castle has sold more than one million copies since it was released. It has won “special praise” on steam platform. It has sold 400000 sets in one year. This achievement is not very high, but it is also very good. The most unexpected thing is that the game is actually developed by Chinese people, so the game has also become one of the first pioneers of domestic independent games, even earlier than the popular domestic work “icey”. Now “Lost Castle” has achieved a million sales worldwide, which has been a very outstanding achievement for an independent studio. After three years, they finally put the game on the mobile platform, trying to set off another wave of hot sales.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Three years ago, the home-made blockbuster game came back again. What kind of game is lost castle/768d88ea28264bd5878ec6ffc15b7b63.jpg" alt="Three years ago, the home-made blockbuster game came back again. What kind of game is lost castle"><br>The total evaluation is over 10000, and the favorable rate is 90%</p>
<h1 id="“hard-core”"><a href="#“hard-core”" class="headerlink" title="“hard core”"></a>“hard core”</h1><p>Looking at the name “Lost Castle” alone, you can obviously feel a very conventional atmosphere, but this feeling is not so annoying. It’s like a fairy tale that everyone knows. Seeing the name, you can probably guess what kind of story the game wants to tell. In a simple way, there is a castle in a remote area. There is an earl in the castle who contacts the black magic because of his own death, so he is eroded and degenerated by the dark forces, and opens the transmission door to the demon world. The whole castle is controlled by the demons, and the player’s role is a treasure hunter who wants to take advantage of the chaos and get something from the castle. So the story of the game begins 。 The core play method of the game is the same as the previous RPG of the underground city. It is also one room after another to explore, and all enemies in the room need to be removed before going to the next room. Due to the addition of rougelite element, death has become the most common thing in the game. Players will get different weapons and explore different maps every time they are reborn Highlight the importance of this element, and the difficulty of the game is not easy.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Three years ago, the home-made blockbuster game came back again. What kind of game is lost castle/a98a56c5cbf849278c22129f64ae8973.jpg" alt="Three years ago, the home-made blockbuster game came back again. What kind of game is lost castle"><br>The producer of Lost Castle is he bin. He has taught himself game design since high school. He always wanted to provide help for game design when he was transferred to university. He Bin’s favorite games are often some works of great difficulty and depth, such as “black soul”, “blood source” under Miyazaki Ying master, and “Monster Hunter” series produced by kapukong, etc., which are famous “hard core” action games. They have master level control over their own game, whether it’s battle rhythm or system design, so These works are often imitated by developers, especially independent developers. But he bin, as an independent gamer, also likes all kinds of independent game masterpieces, such as famine and the combination of Isaac, which provide him with many design ideas. He Bin co founded Hunter studios with two friends he met while learning game design, because they all like monster hunter and blood source very much, so it’s really some of the second breath.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Three years ago, the home-made blockbuster game came back again. What kind of game is lost castle/ff41e2e7b0d54e22beb4d77e948873bf.jpg" alt="Three years ago, the home-made blockbuster game came back again. What kind of game is lost castle"><br>Three founders of the studio, he bin in the middle</p>
<h1 id="against-the-current"><a href="#against-the-current" class="headerlink" title="against the current"></a>against the current</h1><p>He Bin wanted to make a horizontal action game with a hard core style when he first set up the project for the game. After all, his ability is not so outstanding. He has tried his best to make a 2D horizontal action game, and he can only flinch from liking 3D action games. At the same time, because of his love for rougelite game, he bin decided to combine the horizontal movement with rougelite, so that the difficulty setting he wanted had a standard, and the content and gameplay of the game could be determined. The reason why we insist on creating a horizontal action game is also related to the current mobile game environment to a large extent. Most of the domestic games start to seize the market after seeing the gold absorption ability of the mobile game. If there is a popular product, it will become the target for everyone to follow, and there will be a bunch of skin games changing soup or medicine on the market, with independent essence God is naturally cynical about this phenomenon. To some extent, “Lost Castle” was born at this opportunity.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Three years ago, the home-made blockbuster game came back again. What kind of game is lost castle/2774c2f59f4f40bb80e50f1b0921fe30.jpg" alt="Three years ago, the home-made blockbuster game came back again. What kind of game is lost castle"><br>At first, it could be touched by a few monsters, and it’s dying<br>The hard core of Lost Castle is reflected in the slow and stiff action of the characters, not too strong in action, and the high damage of the little monsters. In most cases, they can only dodge the enemy’s attack by walking. Because of the use of the eight direction two-dimensional movement mode and the small range of attack judgment, attacks often occur in the air. Strictly speaking, the overall design tends to the early years The horizontal version of action arcade game, but if compared with the arcade, there is still a lot of sense of impact and screen impact. In the aspect of fighting, different from the general horizontal arcade game is that the protagonist can try different attack modes by changing different kinds of weapons, such as large sword range, high damage, slow attack speed, easy to hit the enemy and easy to be hit at the same time, while different types of similar weapons also have different special effects. In short, this setting is similar to “Monster Hunter”. Each weapon is a different way of fighting, while “Lost Castle” puts the process of weapon selection directly into the game process, rather than fixing it for players before fighting.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Three years ago, the home-made blockbuster game came back again. What kind of game is lost castle/461c350be45f43e9804027f1f47fbb3e.jpg" alt="Three years ago, the home-made blockbuster game came back again. What kind of game is lost castle"><br>There are many weapon styles<br>Players familiar with “Monster Hunter” should know that the greatest pleasure of this game is to challenge all kinds of Monsters online with their friends. Therefore, “Lost Castle” also adds a multi person online system similar to the arcade game in the early years, to take risks with their friends. In multiplayer mode, the number of monsters will increase significantly. The items dropped from fighting monsters also need to compete with friends. In addition to the intense stimulation of cooperation in fighting, it’s also fun to throw one item at another to kill each other. From an objective point of view, the design idea of this game is very excellent, and the performance in the actual experience is not too big except for a little bit difficult, while the game itself has a relatively obscure disadvantage, which is the lack of consistency. Some parts of the game are made very well, while some parts are rough, such as the artistic design of characters and scenes Although it belongs to the medium level, it seems very rigid in animation performance. The design of dialogue, characters and props is slightly out of tune with the overall style of the game, which not only affects the overall view, but also may affect the game experience.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Three years ago, the home-made blockbuster game came back again. What kind of game is lost castle/eb5d734507394630b8d06df9679c2b1e.jpg" alt="Three years ago, the home-made blockbuster game came back again. What kind of game is lost castle"><br>The rendering of scene objects is not compatible with the whole scene<br>    concluding remarks<br>Lost Castle, as a work developed by a fledgling studio, has a good performance as a whole. What’s more, for a Chinese game studio, although it is not so excellent, at least it can make Chinese players praise more than belittle when discussing the game to a greater extent. Logging in to the mobile platform is undoubtedly an opportunity for the game to be re exposed to people’s vision. Maybe some people will buy a try, and some people will not choose to buy it. For a game that can start a game at any time, maybe logging in to the mobile platform is a good choice. This feeling is like playing Monster Hunter online in PSP in the early years It’s just a different era.</p>

    <title>The second spring of classic FPS</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/The%20second%20spring%20of%20classic%20FPS/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>If you want to ask what kind of game is the most popular at present, it is undoubtedly a multi player competitive game. No matter MoBa or shooting, it has a high enthusiasm. If it is not because “fighting with people has endless fun”, it must be because “solo music is not as good as all music”. Among them, shooting game, as the “gun” in “gun car ball”, is still a major force of video games until now. Among all the most popular game types, shooting game is the most senior one. This series has experienced nearly 26 years, during which there have been no several evolutions and innovations, and now it has been divided into various styles.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The second spring of classic FPS/6188470c9fbe488a8e5af9aca3c5b8c6.jpg" alt="The second spring of classic FPS"><br>In the early years, FPS focused on simple and direct game experience. It only needed to shoot all the enemies rushing to you on the screen. There was no plot depth, and it didn’t need to care about the background setting. In short, it just needed to pull the trigger. Due to the retro thinking, we now call this kind of game classic FPS. This type of work is still being launched, but it is not as brilliant as it used to be. However, from the recent momentum, it seems that classic FPS has found a chance to return.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The second spring of classic FPS/683e0f9b701a4e50b6515bd02ec1145c.jpg" alt="The second spring of classic FPS"></p>
<h1 id="“old”-thinking"><a href="#“old”-thinking" class="headerlink" title="“old” thinking"></a>“old” thinking</h1><p>From the end of last century to the beginning of this century, it is not only the golden period of video games, but also the most confused period. During this period, a variety of works with revolutionary nature and industry benchmark level were born. Due to the gradual popularity of home hosts and computers, video games have gradually become a very popular form of entertainment. Therefore, the competition in the game market has become fierce. Some people can be regarded as conservatives, while others can be regarded as innovators. The former tends to refer to successful cases to ensure a stable quality of the game, while the latter always wants to explore new and more distinctive game elements. In the early years, the classic FPS was the most popular FPS game at that time because of the leading role of id software’s “destroyer” series, the simple and happy game playing method and the fast-paced multiplayer combat mode. With “destroyer” as a pioneer, there are many other manufacturers who want to take a share. Among them, 3D reals, as a representative, has created classic FPS works such as “destroyer” and “Shadow Warrior”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The second spring of classic FPS/2498213972ea4938b215a9313db23670.jpg" alt="The second spring of classic FPS"><br>Destroy the Duke<br>These retro FPS have one thing in common, or this is the cultural trend at that time. They all have certain restriction level elements, such as beautifying violence and bloody content, and adding some black humor elements, which is the same as the popular r-level and B-level films at that time. Then, due to the appearance of half life produced by valve, it is possible to add script narrative setting in FPS games. At the same time, the emergence of mod in anti terrorist elite will lead FPs to a new height in multiplayer combat, which leads to the emergence of FPS with half life as the watershed, and FPS games with moderate game rhythm and immersion FPS games with emphasis on narrative The former retro FPS has suddenly declined in popularity, so if the classical FPS wants to survive, it also needs to be reformed and upgraded to some extent. With the improvement of game development technology, the use of full 3D pictures with better performance and real-time calculation with better performance gradually become the mainstream, which may be the key to the breakthrough of classical FPS.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The second spring of classic FPS/e9358512c3c04ca880ba8035167d2ba7.jpg" alt="The second spring of classic FPS"><br>Half a life<br>The characteristics of classic FPs are as mentioned above. The plot is relatively weak, and there is no too complex game mechanism. Players can use a variety of cool big killers to kill the enemy to the ground. Most of the works have no design even for the setting of “reload ammunition”. What players need to do is to avoid the enemy’s attack, aim at the enemy and pull the trigger. This kind of design is not only used in the single machine works of retro FPS, but also in the mode of multi person battle. For example, hammer of thunder and unreal arena adopt this style. Players need to let their attacks hit the enemy as much as possible when they are moving at high speed, so as to generate a game mode called “arena FPS”. If the classical FPS wants to keep pace with the times, it may be a good idea to add some popular and common elements to the existing framework.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The second spring of classic FPS/7840b9019685477dbc9cea69df387732.jpg" alt="The second spring of classic FPS"><br>Hammer of thunder 2<br>     try<br>The first successful classic FPS game in the next generation is called “hero Sam”, which is a name that many players will not be unfamiliar with. The main players of this series use their own power to kill enemies of different types and surges in the open scene with various weapons. In 2001, it was rare to realize a game like “hero Sam” with gorgeous scenes and excellent pictures on the PC platform. The combination of exotic customs and alien monsters also formed a magical chemical reaction. Monsters and weapons are various, the style of the scene is open and changeable, and the colored egg elements are everywhere, except that the game needs to consume a lot of time in the later stage, There is almost nothing wrong with this work. However, some people may not believe that the all 3dfps, such as hero Sam, is an independent game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The second spring of classic FPS/318bffc51a9c4a1ca650bc1ab484c5fe.jpg" alt="The second spring of classic FPS"><br>Hero Sam: second encounter<br>On the other hand, in addition to hero Sam launching multiple sequels as a representative of classic FPS games, many classic old IPS are also constantly trying to break through, such as id software’s “destroyer”, “German headquarters” and “Thunderbolt hammer” are always trying to add new elements to the game to provide different game experience, but the final effect is all It’s not particularly good. For example, “destroyer 3” and “back to German headquarters” began to try to imitate “half life” to enrich the game plot and introduce the elements of terror, “hammer of thunderbolt” directly abandoned the single player mode and focused on multi player combat. Obviously, the attempt of id software in the first few years did not succeed. The next door “Duke of destruction” launched a sequel “Duke of eternal destruction” after 13 years of ticket skipping, although it was poorly evaluated, it was quite interesting. After many years, shadow warrior ushered in a restart, winning the recognition of the players with its excellent painting and excellent fighting experience.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The second spring of classic FPS/b79406eded114f3197b7f612a4d2ae44.jpg" alt="The second spring of classic FPS"><br>Restart version of Shadow Warrior<br>After that, ID realized his own problems, and let many of his works return to the original game style and enlarge its characteristics. The brand-new rebooted “destroyer” and the brand-new style “German army headquarters” have gained good reputation, and have become the two top brands of Bethesda’s dealers. Meanwhile, he has also made a comparison with the introduction of “fury” with the theme of wasteland Ideal results. In contrast, the frequency of other manufacturers’ works is much less, but the related works in the field of independent games are very common. There are a series of “killing space” that emphasizes the online cooperation of multiple people, and there are many “dusk” and “ion Maiden” that tend to restore the ancient pictures together, because the ancient pictures and development concept are very important for The technical requirements are not high, so if there are independent gamers who want to do FPS, the classical type will be the first choice.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The second spring of classic FPS/90fb9160cdb44179ac63607e37735ea1.jpg" alt="The second spring of classic FPS"><br>Plasma girl<br>    concluding remarks<br>To a large extent, the reason why the classic FPS game can survive to now is not that the arena FPS like “hammer of thunderbolt” has been almost eliminated by the market. On the one hand, it is due to the combination of old IP and new elements by large manufacturers, on the other hand, it is due to the continuous love of independent gamers. FPS is a small circle, which can interact with each other without interference or easily. At least from the current market, although the classical FPS has received a cold shoulder, the developers do not want to abandon its idea, such as the new “destroyer: Forever”, “fury 2”, and even “no land 3” are constantly trying to integrate into the new yuan It’s a good thing that we keep our vitality. After all, FPS games on the market are homogenized seriously. It’s a wise choice to stick to our own characteristics.</p>

    <title>Tired of fighting and killing, it&#39;s better to hoe the land. Simulated farm is not just a pension game</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/Tired%20of%20fighting%20and%20killing,%20it&#39;s%20better%20to%20hoe%20the%20land.%20Simulated%20farm%20is%20not%20just%20a%20pension%20game/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>There are many kinds of video games, but the most popular ones are always those. Since ancient times, foreign countries can’t get rid of the car ball without shooting, and domestic can’t get rid of the immortal, the hero and the devil. No matter which kind of games are mainly based on confrontation or fighting, the game rhythm is faster and the playing method is more intense. Only a small number of people are not very interested in these “intense” activities. They prefer to experience a little relaxed and comfortable feeling in the game, such as being a mayor to manage urban planning, or being a chef to manage a restaurant. These games, which have both leisure and depth, and play more freehand, are usually called “pension Games”.<br>When it comes to this name, many people will think of a game in an instant. It may be called “European truck simulation” or “star dew Valley story”. The main purpose of these works is to experience the feeling of returning to nature in the game. In many works, the most popular one is the “simulation farm” series.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Tired of fighting and killing, it's better to hoe the land. Simulated farm is not just a pension game/f0d5bacb40304c87a3c770c1ee27df40.jpg" alt="Tired of fighting and killing, it&#39;s better to hoe the land. Simulated farm is not just a pension game"></p>
<h1 id="the-most-popular-hard-core-game"><a href="#the-most-popular-hard-core-game" class="headerlink" title="the most popular hard core game"></a>the most popular hard core game</h1><p>“Farming Simulator” is a series of simulation business Games launched by giants software in 20087. So far, it has launched 11 works, and the studio has gone through 11 years at the same time. At first, the company was only four people, but now the number has doubled 200 times, becoming one of the most successful game developers in Europe. When it comes to agricultural simulation management games, it is estimated that the first thought of most people should be the process of carrying a hoe and a bucket, running to the field to cultivate and sow a little, and taking good care of them to get the harvest.<br>In fact, in most people’s impression, farming is exactly like this. Because of the primitive way, it can be used in many game works that are not the main farming work, such as all kinds of survival or open world works. But in “simulation farm”, it is a real modern heavy machinery agriculture, revealing a “hard core” breath from the bone. The playing method of the game is to personally control these “giants” step by step to complete the process of farming. During this period, the players should not only master the methods of planting and management, but also focus on how to smoothly control these large machines.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Tired of fighting and killing, it's better to hoe the land. Simulated farm is not just a pension game/7a264314200241b68b36523231e9fc7d.jpg" alt="Tired of fighting and killing, it&#39;s better to hoe the land. Simulated farm is not just a pension game"><br>Take the simplest plowing as an example. Players need to first sit in their own tractors and control the tractors to connect with the moldboard plows, then drive the tractors to pull the plows to cultivate in the fields, and the driving steps of the tractors are absolutely realistic style, which can not be said to be difficult but very tedious.<br>Almost most of the work is done in this way. During this period, players need to change different tools for tractors according to different steps. After all the planting work is completed, they are also responsible for loading, transportation and trading in person. It can be said that it completely restores a real working process of modern European farmers. Some people will think that they are tired enough to work and earn money. Who will have the heart to work hard in the game? Of course, there are people, and there are not a few. So far, 11 works of the simulation farm series have reached a sales volume of 10 million. The latest work “simulation farm 19” launched at the end of last year has sold 1 million copies in ten days, and about 15000 people are online on the same day when it was launched, pushing a number of 3A works to the top of the game sales list.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Tired of fighting and killing, it's better to hoe the land. Simulated farm is not just a pension game/51750c5bc22c4c6184d74787b69d3fbb.jpg" alt="Tired of fighting and killing, it&#39;s better to hoe the land. Simulated farm is not just a pension game"></p>
<p>#Some people just love farming<br>As we all know, simulation games always have only a small number of audience groups because of their hard core playing methods, such as the military simulation game “armed raids” and the simulation car “magic KOSHA”, which are more difficult to start with. Most people prefer simple and direct playing methods and get the most intuitive fun. So why is the “simulated farm” series so popular, and the sales of each generation are increasing? In fact, according to the statistics of developers giants software, nearly a quarter of their loyal fans are not “players” in the traditional sense. They are really engaged in agricultural related work in reality, and nearly half of them are “full-time farmers” in the real sense, which goes back to the one above The question is, why do these people play a farming game when they are farmers?<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Tired of fighting and killing, it's better to hoe the land. Simulated farm is not just a pension game/e275aacca98b4e55b68ed728cd96771a.jpg" alt="Tired of fighting and killing, it&#39;s better to hoe the land. Simulated farm is not just a pension game"><br>Armed raid 3<br>The main reason why these people choose this game is that they can learn from the experience of how to run a farm, as well as access to the equipment and environment that may be far away from reality. Nick Wilke is a farmer of Welker frame Inc., a 10000 acre wheat farm in Montana. His hobby in his spare time is to play simulation farm. Wilke said that in “simulation farm”, he can enjoy a sense of achievement higher than running a farm in reality, and the simulation degree and details of “simulation farm” are more detailed than other similar works, such as the cost of farming will rise, and the price will fluctuate from time to time. If he can master these changes skillfully in the game, So it’s also helpful to run a real farm. It is worth mentioning that Wilke’s farm is also added to the game in the original proportion.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Tired of fighting and killing, it's better to hoe the land. Simulated farm is not just a pension game/06d29f33110d46fa87feba6abd58c1eb.jpg" alt="Tired of fighting and killing, it&#39;s better to hoe the land. Simulated farm is not just a pension game"><br>Nick Wilke and his farm</p>
<h1 id="online-and-offline"><a href="#online-and-offline" class="headerlink" title="online and offline"></a>online and offline</h1><p>In the latest work simulation farm 19, there are hundreds of well-known agricultural machinery brands, all of which are authorized by manufacturers. This is absolutely the most attractive existence for the players who like simulation games, and the best opportunity for those who are farmers themselves to experience advanced agricultural machinery. What outsiders don’t know is that in reality, the famous brands of advanced agricultural machinery The price is comparable to many luxury super runs. The play method of the game itself is a sandbox mode with high degree of freedom. There is no fixed task or goal. The player can plant the game according to his own preferences. The game itself is rich in single player’s playability and playability. The game itself also contains online content of multiple people, whether they cooperate to complete the work or recall to harm each other, which makes the relatively boring play method more interesting Taste, strictly speaking, the game experience of multiplayer online and stand-alone mode is quite different, which can be regarded as the game with the same operation but different content.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Tired of fighting and killing, it's better to hoe the land. Simulated farm is not just a pension game/a63618b23f4e48a1a7a135bdc3457f16.jpg" alt="Tired of fighting and killing, it&#39;s better to hoe the land. Simulated farm is not just a pension game"><br>Since many years ago, giants software has regularly held “farm con”, an offline activity for fans of “simulated farm”, which enables loyal players of the game to face-to-face communicate with the development team. The development team can not only share their design concept and outlook for the new content, but also those professional “farmers” who are able to farm themselves in reality Experience and experience tell developers as the inspiration source of game design, such as the driving feel of a brand’s vehicle, crop growth habits in different regions, can become the design details in the process of game design.<br>In addition to the exchange meeting, GS also held the competition of “simulation farm” in recent years. Last year’s main project was haystack, while this year’s project is 3v3, which collects wheat with a bonus of 100000 euros. Don’t laugh. Competitive agricultural activities have always existed in reality, but this time it was changed to the form of video games. Its purpose is not to earn the best, but to show the outside world that agriculture is also full of fun and competition, so as to attract more people to participate in the agricultural industry.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Tired of fighting and killing, it's better to hoe the land. Simulated farm is not just a pension game/a4529bc324154e8a9da7ed71f6d7ee64.jpg" alt="Tired of fighting and killing, it&#39;s better to hoe the land. Simulated farm is not just a pension game"><br>Last year’s haystack competition<br>    concluding remarks<br>Up to now, “simulation farm” has not been a simple “hoe Simulator”. More often, its function is to let many people who don’t like playing games find common topics, which can be both leisure and deep, and even become a means of propaganda for the work of agriculture. With a unique way to prove to the outside world that video games can carry more than just things Entertainment.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Tired of fighting and killing, it's better to hoe the land. Simulated farm is not just a pension game/4544d7c7440a4fc199ff21133363f5c6.jpg" alt="Tired of fighting and killing, it&#39;s better to hoe the land. Simulated farm is not just a pension game"><br>“Simulated farm” itself emphasizes experience and neglects target. Even playing as a pure game is a very good work. For those players who are immersed in “having fun with people”, this slow-paced game is obviously not suitable for them. For those players who are used to eating big fish and big meat and want to change their tastes, it’s a fresh and endurable “bite” “Xiangtang” is not a suitable choice.</p>

    <title>Transformers, a movie and TV toy that blooms but falls in the game world</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/Transformers,%20a%20movie%20and%20TV%20toy%20that%20blooms%20but%20falls%20in%20the%20game%20world/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Towards the end of 2018, Paramount Pictures in the United States launched the latest personal work “Bumblebee” of “Transformers” series after several twists and turns. As we all know, before this, due to the chaos of plot logic and extremely inconsistent with the original character settings, and a large number of embedded advertisements in the film, the word-of-mouth of each work is gradually declining, neither fans nor passers-by audiences can agree that this is a “Transformers” work. After the change of director, “Bumblebee” has changed the shape of each transformer in the live action movie, from the theme of evil to the fetter between man and robot, and the new work of taking the emotional card has captured the hearts of the audience again, at the same time, it also makes this series have the hope of rejuvenating again.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Transformers, a movie and TV toy that blooms but falls in the game world/3de417e543a44f8a95a76902c2e176f6.jpg" alt="Transformers, a movie and TV toy that blooms but falls in the game world"><br>In any case, “Transformers” series started with selling toys. Each film and television work is just an auxiliary to promote the sales of toys. According to the different styles of cartoons, the styles of toys will change together. With the continuous improvement of the world view of transformers in various kinds of film and television works, it’s hard to say that we don’t need to play a game. There was a period when there was a transformer game in the field of game almost every other period of time, but somehow, it’s gone.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Transformers, a movie and TV toy that blooms but falls in the game world/25ead5a8f433414f9b62963545cbb83d.jpg" alt="Transformers, a movie and TV toy that blooms but falls in the game world"></p>
<h1 id="American-dolls-of-Oriental-origin"><a href="#American-dolls-of-Oriental-origin" class="headerlink" title="American dolls of Oriental origin"></a>American dolls of Oriental origin</h1><p>Since the 1960s, robot culture has been particularly popular in Japan. One of the manga masters “Astro Boy in the iron wall” is very popular. In the 1980s, the popularity of works such as “Doraemon” and “mobile fighter Gotha” made the influence of robot elements in Japan unusual. As the technology of the toy industry matures, Takara, a Japanese toy manufacturer, plans to launch a series of robot toys. Unlike before, these robots can be transformed into airplanes, sports cars, various weapons and even many common digital products in life. Each element is something that boys like very much. When combined, they will become more attractive, In addition to being able to deform, some robots can also be combined and assembled with each other to become larger and more handsome robots, which Takara named “dayaclone”. Today, dyakron continues to launch this new work (style is more like science fiction robot), and the shape and design of these deformable robots are also more handsome and flexible, which are deeply loved by fans in Japan.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Transformers, a movie and TV toy that blooms but falls in the game world/c88598feb78746d4b07a9fd576a803ac.jpg" alt="Transformers, a movie and TV toy that blooms but falls in the game world"><br>Dai Ya clone<br>After daiakron became popular in the Japanese market, many European and American toy manufacturers saw business opportunities from it, so they introduced this popular product to the local market. Among many manufacturers, a company named Hasbro recognized Takara through daiakron. They had a far-reaching idea. So they flew all the way to Japan to seek cooperation with Takara, bought the role copyright of several branches of Takara daiakron’s series, and brought it back to the United States to build a brand-new brand. The corner of this new brand Takara is still in charge of color design, while Hasbro named the new series transformers for the European and American markets. Hasbro also learned from the Japanese toy sales experience, designed a very detailed setting for each character in the transformers series, and shaped a huge world view for it to launch relevant animation, which is the first “Transformers” work touched by many old fans.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Transformers, a movie and TV toy that blooms but falls in the game world/fc85e79c90e944c29a25dbecbd124796.jpg" alt="Transformers, a movie and TV toy that blooms but falls in the game world"></p>
<h1 id="adaptation-period"><a href="#adaptation-period" class="headerlink" title="adaptation period"></a>adaptation period</h1><p>Soon, the series of transformers spread all over the streets, almost no one knows the names of “prime” and “Megatron”. After returning to Japan, this series from a long way back is another gesture, and its influence even exceeds that of his predecessor, daiyakelon. “Transformers” is no longer a simple series of players and animation, but also has gradually become an influential big IP. The surrounding products are also selling vigorously, and naturally there is no lack of a video game. According to the available historical records, the earliest “Transformers” game was born in 1995. It is the exclusive work of Commodore 64. In essence, it’s a kind of arcade style light gun shooting game. You only need to click the enemy to fire. As the main character, transformers didn’t even appear in the game several times. I believe fans want to be sure that it’s not this.<br>The first game that looks good in the real sense is FC game Optimus Prime’s secret, which is only released in Japan. This is a horizontal action game, but although there is Optimus Prime in the title, the protagonist of the game is the second generation of leaders who are familiar with the sky. This game is not only unreasonable in design, but also the transformer’s biggest characteristic “deformation” has no use in the game , it’s just a wave of enthusiasm, so this game is also a piece of rubbish in the eyes of many fans.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Transformers, a movie and TV toy that blooms but falls in the game world/de2679910a12454591e1881730621397.jpg" alt="Transformers, a movie and TV toy that blooms but falls in the game world"><br>The secret of Optimus Prime<br>For many years since then, transformers has been launching new works of various styles, but the quality is not ideal. Until 2007, the real-life version of “Transformers” directed by Michael Bay, which I mentioned at the beginning of the article, was released. The more realistic and handsome shape made the big IP with a history of nearly 30 years come to life again. At this time, the “Transformers” was more in line with the modern aesthetic, and the realistic style was easier to make a game, so I focused on film and television adaptation Pin’s moviemaker came out and took over the work of movie adaptation. This generation of works is the most impressive one for the author. The game well restores the deformation effect of strong metal friction in the movie, and adds many original contents. However, the game itself has a low playability and a weak sense of attack. Most of the branch contents are mainly collected, and the media even fail to pass the evaluation, but one code for one code, with different roles’ emphasis It’s cool that the attack can fly the enemy far away and take up the facilities in the city and throw them at each other.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Transformers, a movie and TV toy that blooms but falls in the game world/a9538e0e469a48ed9aeb5b7ff5676325.jpg" alt="Transformers, a movie and TV toy that blooms but falls in the game world"></p>
<h1 id="the-fall-of-Cybertron"><a href="#the-fall-of-Cybertron" class="headerlink" title="the fall of Cybertron"></a>the fall of Cybertron</h1><p>Since then, live action films have launched new works in two years, and adaptation games have also been launched almost together with the films. As the article said at the beginning, the word-of-mouth of films is lower than that of generations, and so is the game. Even when the film is released to the fifth film, adaptation works have not been launched directly. Naturally, the influence of the movie doesn’t need to be said much, but in the aspect of dynamic vision, we want to put each generation’s works on as many platforms as possible, so there are several different versions of a generation of games. The quality of the PC version and the main board that occupy the majority of the movie itself is not very good, let alone the screen and content castrate the more ruthless palm version. After the second-generation movie “Revenge of Fallen King Kong” was launched by Activision, a new round of cooperation was reached with Hasbro. It is planned to launch a series of original style works based on the setting of “Transformers” and submit them to other studios for production, which is called “battle of Cybertron”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Transformers, a movie and TV toy that blooms but falls in the game world/fa56729e1ae04baea2a2d662ec9ce7d5.jpg" alt="Transformers, a movie and TV toy that blooms but falls in the game world"><br>Battle of Cybertron<br>Based on the original work, the series strengthens the science fiction elements and integrates the realistic style, forming a unique style, breaking away from the limitation of the inherent framework, and focusing the story on Saibotan, the mother star of transformers. This work can highlight the unique pleasure of “transfiguration battle” in transformers to the greatest extent. This work integrates action and shooting, and integrates the overall playability and The production quality is better than that of the film adaptation. Some players even say that this is the best “Transformers” game ever. And two years later, motion TV brought the sequel “the fall of Cybertron”. This work was made by the original team, which has been improved in all aspects. The score of the game has broken through the bottleneck of eight points unprecedented. Fans and passers-by are full of praise for it. In many people’s eyes, it may be difficult to surpass this work in the future. However, the fans of transformers are only a small part of the game circle. Even though “the fall of Cybertron” has received unprecedented praise, the sales volume has not achieved the same results as the public praise. Unfortunately, mobile TV no longer plans to launch a sequel to the series.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Transformers, a movie and TV toy that blooms but falls in the game world/4b502cbf8a52446da5d72d508f8c86a9.jpg" alt="Transformers, a movie and TV toy that blooms but falls in the game world"><br>The fall of Cybertron<br>    concluding remarks<br>In October 2015, Activision plans to make its last blog, and launched a next-generation work “Transformers: destruction” in the original cartoon style. It is worth mentioning that this work is developed by platinum studio, a famous action game developer. Although it can circle in the performance of the battle, there are problems in the design of the game itself in the system and the planning of the game’s branch content Therefore, the score of the game is basically the same as that of “battle of Cybertron”, which is quite reasonable. However, at this time, the transformers in the game field has already lost its enthusiasm, and the sales volume of the game is not ideal, and even the PS4 version of the Bank of China has been launched specially for Chinese players, which still fails to pull back the situation. This dynamic vision is to completely put down the IP of “Transformers”, which is also regarded as propaganda It’s the end of the development of transformers 3A game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Transformers, a movie and TV toy that blooms but falls in the game world/0b9297e28781461ca4d47a4e7e138b5b.jpg" alt="Transformers, a movie and TV toy that blooms but falls in the game world"><br>Transformers: Destruction<br>In the field of toys, transformers is known as the second incredible toy in the world (the first is Lego), because the design idea of each product is really unimaginable; in the field of film and television, there are many animation works of transformers, and most of them have good reputation. Although the film has suffered Waterloo before, it is seen as a pure “popcorn” movie It’s OK, the fighting scene is also quite wonderful, and then it turns around after changing the producer. As for the game field, it seems that the transformers series has never really been popular, it’s just an accessory of the accessory products, maybe only fans who really love this series will try, and the base of this kind of fans is a little pitiful.<br>Transformers carries too many memories of our childhood. Maybe it’s time for him to have a good rest, but Hasbro still hopes to sell toys to earn money. So in the future, maybe we can see the struggle between Optimus Prime and Megatron, but we can’t know how this process will work.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>Recently, the game circle has entered the off-season when the game lineup is relatively scarce. There are only one or two major works that can attract the attention of the players. Some players may be busy incubating their desired Baoke dream at this time, and some players are sending them over the mountains. “Stranded in death” is undoubtedly the most controversial 3A level game this year. No one likes it. People who like it can’t help themselves. People who don’t like it may not stick to it at the beginning of the game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The social chain system in stranded in death is nothing new/721fd84b2077429a88bf7072947ee763.jpg" alt="The social chain system in stranded in death is nothing new"><br>When death ran aground first announced the core playing methods of the game to the public, the game producer Xiufu Oshima strongly publicized the game mechanism of the game, which he called himself “social chain system”. Although players can’t see other players in the game, they can see traces left by other players in the game, such as road signs, props and vehicles And to help players, so that players even in a single game, there will be a sense of connection with players around the world at all times. In fact, the so-called “social chain” system is not created by the island, but “stranded in death” is undoubtedly the best work to show this mechanism.<br>The origin of<br>The concept of game has appeared immediately since people have the sense of entertainment, and the original game has no too complex rules, such as all kinds of popular chess and card games, in essence, they are all turn games, all of them are one person performing their own steps and then suddenly changing to the next person. The biggest limitation of these games is that it must be played face to face by several people. It is inevitable that even if two friends are in a foreign country, they want to come to the last game. Therefore, some people begin to think about how to make two people play the last game even if they are not together. At that time, when there was no Internet, someone thought of sending the board by post, drawing the board and board on a piece of paper, indicating their own execution steps, and then sending the paper to another player who participated in the game, while another person also sent the paper back in the same way, so that the game would be completed again and again, and as for how long the game would take See if the postman is going fast.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The social chain system in stranded in death is nothing new/f5d98fdf030a494a81a7e5cd7844363f.jpg" alt="The social chain system in stranded in death is nothing new"><br>First, there is the mail chess, and then other chess and cards are added to it. Later, even some large-scale board games have launched the mail version, which is very popular. Even there are many companies and media specializing in the mail game, and some companies are still operating today.<br>Later, with the gradual popularization of home computers and the development of the Internet, even video games have entered the information age. E-mail has become a more efficient online way to replace the traditional mail based games. Undoubtedly, e-mail is much faster than ordinary letters. Therefore, a new mechanism of online confrontation game has been derived. It is a classic game created by micro prose Strategy game “X-Com” and “heroes of Magic 3” produced by 3Do use e-mail online, and their online way is to send the game’s archive to the opponent player after the player completes a round of execution, and then send the archive back after the other player takes over the archive. Although it’s much faster, it’s essentially the same as the traditional postal way of thinking.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The social chain system in stranded in death is nothing new/6aef8a032a2246438c836da609d063b5.jpg" alt="The social chain system in stranded in death is nothing new"><br>Heroes of Magic 3 (the picture is a high-definition replica)<br>    nostalgia<br>Later, the multiplayer online game has developed into a familiar pattern. Players can interact with each other without delay, while the slow-paced online game mode of mailing is no longer favored by developers. If you look at it from the current perspective, the mail game is undoubtedly very slow and troublesome, both time-consuming and laborious, but there is a unique romantic atmosphere that only old games can have.<br>The “social chain” system used in “stranding to death” is called “asynchronous online” in the development field, and mail game is the design prototype of asynchronous online, which aims to generate interaction even if the player is not in the same time and the same area, sometimes when the player is not online, other players can also interact with it, to a greater extent, asynchronous online design Inspired by games that used e-mail online in the early years, the current friend systems of all kinds of mobile games are the same. Even if the player is not online, you can pick up a character or a resource from your friend.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The social chain system in stranded in death is nothing new/2955c79f278f4de78e8f7eadb578422f.jpg" alt="The social chain system in stranded in death is nothing new"><br>Large facilities can also be built by multiple players<br>With the mail game gradually fading out of the players’ vision, asynchronous online has more often changed from the “core” of a game to a “mechanism” in the game. Although it will not appear as the core of the game, it can also make the game more interesting. Initially, this setting often appears in many racing games, and the players’ racing records will be “ghost” The form of “car” appears directly on the track, and later in many pseudo real style racing games, players can actively download other players’ ghost cars to learn the operation of other players and challenge their records, etc.<br>For the vast majority of players, the concept of “asynchronous online” may come into contact for the first time in the game, mostly from the “soul of darkness” series and “blood source” produced by from software. No matter which series, players can leave notes at specific points, and other players can see it after passing here. Some of these notes are good intentions Show, and there are malicious jokes, and even can see other players died in situ left traces and projections.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The social chain system in stranded in death is nothing new/7d062d9001994ca7b25539bf3133499e.jpg" alt="The social chain system in stranded in death is nothing new"><br>The marks on the ground can attract friendly players or hostile players<br>To a large extent, perhaps these asynchronous online settings in the “soul” series are the nostalgia of developers Miyazaki YingGAO for the once mail based game. After all, there are not many people who know the name at present. With the foresight of the “soul” series, it also provides inspiration for many later works: as RenWang, which is also a “black soul like” game, is more biased and “brush”, so there are many ways to obtain equipment in the game, in which players can also see the traces left by other players after death, but players can not only see, but also play other games The players who are recruited are not the players themselves, but the “crazy corpses” controlled by the computer. They wear the same equipment as the original players, and have a chance to get one of them after killing. Because the equipment of other players is usually excellent, they also give the players the motivation to fight with them, which is one of the core playing methods of the game Ring.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The social chain system in stranded in death is nothing new/4b57c356a7fd4a80893c6ee38ef389e7.jpg" alt="The social chain system in stranded in death is nothing new"><br>Sword tomb left by players after death in benevolent King<br>    concluding remarks<br>I vaguely remember watching a movie called “the fast Racer” a long time ago. The protagonist began to compete with others in a race. The fastest record holder of this race track was the protagonist’s brother, but unfortunately he was no longer there. The race was so superb that he was about to break his brother’s record, but he finally let go of the gas before rushing to the end I kept my brother’s fastest record. Then I heard a similar story many years ago, but the protagonist was a little brother who lost his father when he was young, and he saw his father’s racing ghost car in the dusty game machine. The little brother also stepped on the brake before he was about to surpass his father to retain his father’s ghost car, because if he won, the record would no longer exist.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/The social chain system in stranded in death is nothing new/ed95558c4eb04821a120aa211222c1dd.jpg" alt="The social chain system in stranded in death is nothing new"><br>Stills of “the fast Racer”<br>This is a concept worth remembering and remembering. It is also an indispensable part of the development of video games. In his own game, Hideki Oshima has changed its mechanism back to the core again. Without this function, the experience of the game will be greatly reduced. Although this person is a little high-profile, his talent is undeniably outstanding. Asynchronous online makes the world see new possibilities again. Maybe in the near future, there will be more new types of multiplayer games.</p>

    <title>Updating to the extinction of the sun radiation 76, gives itself a problem that will not be solved</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/Updating%20to%20the%20extinction%20of%20the%20sun%20radiation%2076,%20gives%20itself%20a%20problem%20that%20will%20not%20be%20solved/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I like American RPG games very much, especially radiation series. Many years ago, I had the idea that we all know that the copyright of radiation series now belongs to Bethesda company in the United States. Its representative work ancient scrolls series has a derivative online game named ancient scrolls ol, which has been in operation for many years. Although I haven’t played it, it seems that the game Quality is OK, so when will b society launch a “radiation” with multi person online elements? I feel that it should be very interesting to build a house together with online tasks.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Updating to the extinction of the sun radiation 76, gives itself a problem that will not be solved/741ea2db861a41ce96441ee588e51082.jpg" alt="Updating to the extinction of the sun radiation 76, gives itself a problem that will not be solved"><br>I believe that there must be more than one person with such an idea. With such a mindset, players have come to the online game “radiation 76”, which they thought had been realized for many years. However, it is unexpected that the overall quality difference of this work in the initial stage is unimaginable, and the controversy surrounding this game is from the beginning of the publication stage It’s always there. Up to now, nearly a year has passed since the game was released, so what about this so-called “update to the sun out” game?<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Updating to the extinction of the sun radiation 76, gives itself a problem that will not be solved/09028afa7ef34497bcfc63c4987618a8.jpg" alt="Updating to the extinction of the sun radiation 76, gives itself a problem that will not be solved"></p>
<h1 id="radiation-4-multiplayer-mode"><a href="#radiation-4-multiplayer-mode" class="headerlink" title="radiation 4 multiplayer mode"></a>radiation 4 multiplayer mode</h1><p>In fact, the development of radiation 76 had a plan as early as radiation 4 had not been completed. It was originally set as the multi person mode of radiation 4. All friends who have played radiation 4 should know that the content of this game is very scarce in the later stage, and the overall optimization and polishing are very problematic, obviously there are traces of catching up, so we can know that the development cycle of the game is very tight.<br>Since the development of the game ontology has been a bit laborious, there is no extra effort to make the multiplayer mode for the game. The style of agency B (here refers to the Bethesda game studio, referred to as BGS) is that the overall experience of the single player mode can not be sacrificed in any way. Although there is a real idea of multiplayer mode in the company, it can only be put aside temporarily, giving priority to the single player mode of radiation 4 After that, we will consider other contents. In 2014, zenimax, the parent company of group B, set up a “battle cry” studio focusing on online game development. The internal core staff of the studio had participated in the development and operation of “cybergenesis” and “Star Wars: the Old Republic”. Shortly after that, they distributed their “sub Era online game” war cry to Grandpa.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Updating to the extinction of the sun radiation 76, gives itself a problem that will not be solved/dbe0a2c261534a16b240cf4a704996a7.jpg" alt="Updating to the extinction of the sun radiation 76, gives itself a problem that will not be solved"><br>The third person action plus “Legion fortress” is “battle roar”<br>A month before the release of radiation 4, zhanhou studio faced a wave of layoffs for economic reasons, which led to the indefinite suspension of the online game called zhanhou. At this time, “radiation 4” has entered the stage of sale, but its development members did not get the rest time, they still need to continue to develop DLC for the game, and the war roar studio is just idle now, so the chief producer of B society, Todd Howard, found war roar: “do you want to try to make a separate multi person mode for our” radiation 4 “<br>Players familiar with BGS should know that BGS has been using the same engine for many years from the beginning of “ancient scroll 3: morning wind”. This engine is a special engine that focuses on the development of single player experience. Its algorithm is far from the way of making multiplayer games, and BGS itself lacks the development experience of multiplayer games, so How to deal with these problems is a big challenge for them (old scroll OL was developed by zenimax online).<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Updating to the extinction of the sun radiation 76, gives itself a problem that will not be solved/60a6e339f48c452da08211139b435fdd.jpg" alt="Updating to the extinction of the sun radiation 76, gives itself a problem that will not be solved"><br>Radiation 4</p>
<p>#Why is it 76?<br>In order to solve this problem, they had to create a new map, and the scale of this map must be larger than that of radiation 4. Agency B chose the east coast of the United States, which they are also familiar with, and West Virginia, which is far away from the main line of the radiation series. This is a very bold idea, because West Virginia is a state, not a district or a city. This is a crazy idea for BGS, which has only done two radiation works Ideas. The background of the game is set in 25 years after the World War II of radiation. All players come from a real “controlled shelter” (a real shelter for people’s protection). They need to return to the ground earlier than anyone before and be responsible for the reconstruction of the country. This shelter is No. 76, so it is named radiation 76. In short, as a pure online game, they need to It’s not an orthodox sequel to distinguish it from the main line of stand-alone works.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Updating to the extinction of the sun radiation 76, gives itself a problem that will not be solved/9a9bd2d19202400f99f3aff6f2a7d361.jpg" alt="Updating to the extinction of the sun radiation 76, gives itself a problem that will not be solved"><br>Radiation 76’s map is four times the size of the previous work, and it is much more exquisite than BGS’s previous work. After all, West Virginia is far away from the place where the war broke out, so the damage suffered here is relatively light, and many beautiful rural landscapes are preserved. Moreover, due to the different accidents in various regions, the environment and ecology in each region are also different.<br>Compared with the previous “radiation” works, the overall color is more bright, the last breath is still in but not so serious, and more people-friendly in sense, so it also attracts many players who have never been exposed to the “radiation” series. Before the release of radiation 76, Todd said that there would be no NPC in the whole game, which made many players lose their eyesight in an instant. The main player of radiation series has a high degree of freedom, which is reflected in both interaction and dialogue, and NPC is the key of the key. Suddenly, it was said that there was no NPC in the work, but from this point, people can’t help worrying about the game Quality.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Updating to the extinction of the sun radiation 76, gives itself a problem that will not be solved/3fb94c86f141437faff496906692f6b1.jpg" alt="Updating to the extinction of the sun radiation 76, gives itself a problem that will not be solved"></p>
<h1 id="lowest-rating-in-history"><a href="#lowest-rating-in-history" class="headerlink" title="lowest rating in history"></a>lowest rating in history</h1><p>Many players have made psychological preparation for “this game will thunder”, but it has brought greater impact to the players unexpectedly: the quality of the first version of the game server is very poor, the amount of bugs in the game itself is so large that each game will have a new experience, and the playing method of the game is very boring, neither like an online game, nor a single game, or always between the two Repeat the cross jump.<br>It’s true that club B has invested a lot in this game, and the design concept of the game is also very good, but it has made a very rough “four unlike”. This moment ignited the anger of the players. The game itself has a 3A level price and 3a level publicity, but the game itself does not even count as a semi-finished product, which is unacceptable to anyone. The score of the game once became the lowest in the whole “radiation” series. Even the “radiation: Iron and steel brotherhood (not that strategic version)” which sells dog meat with sheep’s head was a passing score, and the players came and went quickly. The players asked for a refund in succession. Even the retailers reduced the price of “radiation 76” less than a week after it was put on sale and half sold and half delivered. They hope that they can get along with each other as soon as possible The game is disconnected.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Updating to the extinction of the sun radiation 76, gives itself a problem that will not be solved/12a133696a7b4298a41e3f1efc783c69.jpg" alt="Updating to the extinction of the sun radiation 76, gives itself a problem that will not be solved"><br>I don’t know how many people have been touched by the song “take me home, country road” in the notice<br>Since then, there have been endless negative news about agency B, no matter in peripheral products or in a series of subsequent operation policies, which fully highlights BGS’s lack of experience in various aspects of online games. At this time, Todd came out to try to save the situation. They stepped up the bug repair speed and announced that each major update had a large number of new content added. This game will be updated all the time and will try their best to solve all the problems.<br>The first large-scale DLC “wild Appalachia” of the game was officially launched nearly five months after the game was released. The bug repair of the updated episode of the content finally changed the game from “can’t play at all” to “just play”. However, it’s still far from Todd’s envisaged posture, and the game still can’t be called fun. At the end of July this year, the game finally released the second large DLC news. In this version, new maps and replicas will be added, and the big escape mode will be added. It can be seen that this IP is also gradually improving.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Updating to the extinction of the sun radiation 76, gives itself a problem that will not be solved/1362ad4118f64d59b25ce2e68e342a92.jpg" alt="Updating to the extinction of the sun radiation 76, gives itself a problem that will not be solved"><br>Next update of radiation 76</p>
<p>#Conclusion<br>A friend who is also a fan of “radiation” said that “radiation” is a half dead IP, which is not easy to be supported by community B, but it is still half dead. This is true. If there is no agency B, there will be no “radiation” today. I believe that no fan would like to see this IP fall. However, the practice of agency B is not flattering. There are not a few game works that are updated and supplemented after selling semi-finished products at the price of 3a in the early stage, but few people can keep up with the difficulties. Most of them are the last half of the update Because the effect is not good and the road abandoned the pit, I really hope that “radiation 76” can gradually improve, otherwise some can take the beautiful scenery of West Virginia.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Updating to the extinction of the sun radiation 76, gives itself a problem that will not be solved/c7929c0217684d2fb0ae7bbb859ed81c.jpg" alt="Updating to the extinction of the sun radiation 76, gives itself a problem that will not be solved"><br>After the event, producer Todd once said: if at the beginning of the game release, all players with radiation 4 are provided with free testing qualification instead of pre order players, and the testing time is longer and the server is open all day, most problems may be solved before the release. The defeat of radiation 76 undoubtedly taught a lesson to B society. I hope their subsequent works will not repeat the same mistakes, and Todd is not just talking about it.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>ICO, which is a familiar and unfamiliar name, now represents one of the most popular blockchain projects, and for gamers, it’s a very old existence. “ICO” is an action adventure game made by teamico in 2001. It has won numerous awards and public praise, but few people have heard of this game, let alone how many players have played it.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Use the whole body senses to enjoy an elegant performance, two and a half games of the poet Shangtian literati/c6f6048bcf474b778d4fbbac908e7a5b.jpg" alt="Use the whole body senses to enjoy an elegant performance, two and a half games of the poet Shangtian literati"><br>“The game is as beautiful as poetry, and the person who created it is a great poet,” the players said. Throughout the whole game industry, many game producers will interpret their works as novels or films, and only the producer of ICO, the Shangtian literati, can express the game as “poetry”.</p>
<h1 id="“art”-is-an-extremely-important-subject"><a href="#“art”-is-an-extremely-important-subject" class="headerlink" title="“art” is an extremely important subject"></a>“art” is an extremely important subject</h1><p>Born in Hyogo, Japan, Shangtian literati like painting very much since childhood, and they are extraordinary. However, Shangtian literati not only like painting, but also have different ideas and views on things. In kindergarten, the school once organized a children’s painting competition, the topic was to draw a turtle. All the children drew a tortoise in a similar way. Of course, the literati Shangtian also drew a tortoise, but unlike other children, he only drew a tortoise shell. His family and teachers were curious about this. Why did he draw a turtle shell? The young Shangtian explained that it was “a turtle with its head and limbs in the shell”. From this we can see that Shangtian is more innovative than other children. After this, he was praised by his family and teachers. And it is after that that, Shangtian has confidence in painting creation.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Use the whole body senses to enjoy an elegant performance, two and a half games of the poet Shangtian literati/b8ab63c17dfe4ffb9e725fd484d524a3.jpg" alt="Use the whole body senses to enjoy an elegant performance, two and a half games of the poet Shangtian literati"><br>Game producer Shangtian literati<br>In principle, the children who like painting should be the top students with stable personality and excellent performance, but the results of the cultural course in Tian are not obvious, which is largely related to his personality. Instead of letting him go to class, he is more willing to lock himself up to draw a picture for a day. In addition to painting, he also likes to go fishing by the river with his friends, or learn to make various tools and small toys with his father. It is not difficult to combine these hobbies. Shangtian is a very creative child. When he was in high school, he chose the nearest art vocational high school for his study. After three years of ignorance, he was admitted to Osaka Art University, not far from home. In fact, he could easily have been admitted to Tokyo Wumei, but he chose to give up because he was too far away.<br>Shangtian seems to take “energy saving” as the primary condition for all his future choices, even choosing the major of abstract painting that “looks easy”. However, after entering university, he didn’t do a good job in painting. He didn’t even go to his favorite art gallery. He didn’t know what he wanted to do in the future. All the reasons were that he was fascinated by another thing: video games.</p>
<p>#Because of interest<br>Near the time when Shangtian graduated from University, it was the stage when the local video game industry in Japan had just developed. Video games began to enter the homes of ordinary people. Shangtian and his roommate were usually bored playing games in their dormitories when they were free. “Since I don’t know what to do, I’d better buy a computer first. It’s useful anyway.”. With this in mind, Ueda purchased an Amiga personal computer. And out of the love for all kinds of art works, just by virtue of his computer graphics processing ability is relatively strong, so he began to study CG technology. Bookstores and online forums have become the most frequently visited places in Shangtian. In order to learn the production technology of CG, Shangtian has broken its leg. After graduating from University, he didn’t choose to find a job directly, but wanted to become an art creator by relying on his own skills. At that time, he realized that CG is a new technology, and the talents who master this technology are the hot spots of many companies, so he decided to find a company to be a CG designer.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Use the whole body senses to enjoy an elegant performance, two and a half games of the poet Shangtian literati/9f81d4b7facd4558b3bda058c7ee381c.jpg" alt="Use the whole body senses to enjoy an elegant performance, two and a half games of the poet Shangtian literati"><br>Amiga PC<br>His first official job was as a game designer of warp company in Japan. When he joined in, he took over a major project: making an action adventure game named “strange spirit” for Sega Saturn mainframe. Although there are many ideas about this game, he is just a young employee. He can’t talk about the overall development of the game. He naturally has a strong personality with such a group and doesn’t come very far. Moreover, the producer of the game is a well-known and strict wise man, so it’s hard for him to fight here. To this, Shangtian was very reluctant, and decided to “finish this ticket, I will go and play my own game.”. At best or not, Shangtian is a man of love. After the completion of the research and development of strange spirits, he chose to leave quietly, go home and continue to study CG technology, and plan to make a game of his own.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Use the whole body senses to enjoy an elegant performance, two and a half games of the poet Shangtian literati/5a0ef0fe99c3457bb5e9349d048cb69a.jpg" alt="Use the whole body senses to enjoy an elegant performance, two and a half games of the poet Shangtian literati"><br>“Strange spirits” game cover<br>In 1997, Mr. Shangtian learned from his friends that a company could recruit talents who could do CG again, but it was still a bit hard for him to rely on himself, which also made him have the intention of looking for a new job. Mr. Shangtian submitted his resume to the company, which was not someone else, but Sony Computer Entertainment SCE, which had just become popular in the game industry. When Sony asked him when he would be able to come to work, he said that he had not finished his work and could not come to work right away. “So how about borrowing this place for you?” Many years later, the strange character of Ueda was once again tolerated and recognized, which made him deeply moved. He immediately decided to join Sony and work hard here.</p>
<h1 id="three-no-games"><a href="#three-no-games" class="headerlink" title="three no games"></a>three no games</h1><p>Given Sony’s emphasis on Ueda, Ueda soon got the chance to make a game, and he hopes to take this opportunity to realize his dream a few years ago. In this game, the protagonist controlled by the player needs to protect a young girl and take her to escape from the devil’s claw. The core concept of the story is “never let go of this person’s hand, or you will give up your soul”. There are not a few lines in the full name of the game, which may not add up to a hundred words. There is no UI, no life value and no item column. The whole picture of the game is as clean as a picture, which is also called “three no games” by players.<br>However, if you look at this work from the current perspective, you will find that its design concept has been used in many game works, and the design of this game is undoubtedly very advanced. Shangtian named his work “ICO” a long time ago. After the game was released, it got unprecedented praise. The players can’t help but sigh that the experience of the game is too wonderful. It has the effect of pulling the players into the world and feeling the incomparable emotion and shock. But contrary to the word-of-mouth of the game, the sales volume of the game didn’t even exceed a million, which made this work not only a model in game design, but also a model of “good but not good”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Use the whole body senses to enjoy an elegant performance, two and a half games of the poet Shangtian literati/fe6246577f434f4a95ffa7162fcbb597.jpg" alt="Use the whole body senses to enjoy an elegant performance, two and a half games of the poet Shangtian literati"><br>ICO game screen<br>The unsatisfactory sales volume of the game is largely related to the unidentified cover design of the game’s name. At the same time, the information technology is not developed enough. Even if there are countless word-of-mouth explosions in the game, few people know about the game. But the high reputation of the game is enough to make Shangtian have the motivation to continue to play the game. This time, there is a very unique concept in his mind: if there is no growth in an RPG game, no brush off and level training, and only the boss war is reserved, what kind of play will this be?<br>A man, a sword, a bow, a horse, a giant statue like a mountain. This is Shangtian’s second work Wanda and the giant statue. In order to revive her lover, Wanda, the protagonist of the game, made a deal with the devil and killed 16 giant statues guarding the world. The tiny body of the protagonist and the towering colossus form a sharp contrast, which brings unprecedented sense of oppression to the players. In addition, Wanda and the Colossus give the players a question: what kind of price can one pay for one’s beloved? Many players can’t calm down for a long time after passing the customs. This is the effect the game wants to bring to the players.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Use the whole body senses to enjoy an elegant performance, two and a half games of the poet Shangtian literati/1f8bf38fd6d84df1918fdfe8e0d31afb.jpg" alt="Use the whole body senses to enjoy an elegant performance, two and a half games of the poet Shangtian literati"><br>Wanda and Colossus<br>In the process of developing Wanda and the Colossus, Shangtian has created a new idea through the fetter between the protagonist and Aima agro. He wants to design a game work in the next game to let the protagonist and an unprecedented creature have fetter to work together. A long time ago, this vivid virtual creature was conceived in the consciousness of Shangtian. Shangtian said that he must try his best to make this creature to the extreme, just as it really exists. However, to reach such a level must mean high consumption and long time. The development cycle of the game drags on and misses the most suitable time to log in to the PS3 host. So Sony The high level decided to let the game skip PS3 and log in to PS4 directly, which caused the dissatisfaction of Ueda. He turned around and left the studio teamico with the core members. Sony did not give up the production of the game because of the departure of Ueda. After all, most of the concept and design of the game have been mature. Sony gave the development of the game to other studios, and sent someone to find Ueda, who has formed a group outside, to continue to cooperate with the development of the game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Use the whole body senses to enjoy an elegant performance, two and a half games of the poet Shangtian literati/466fdb8f620245a4b194d6a8f34cbe81.jpg" alt="Use the whole body senses to enjoy an elegant performance, two and a half games of the poet Shangtian literati"><br>Big Griffins like cats, dogs and eagles</p>
<h1 id="end"><a href="#end" class="headerlink" title="end"></a>end</h1><p>Just as the players were worried about the life and death of the new work, Sony released the game called “the last guardian”, which is still the familiar style and the familiar warmth. Shangtian once again played a beautiful poem for the players with his unique style. However, it seems to be Shangtian’s excessive pursuit of “literature and art atmosphere”. Although it has done very well in the picture, atmosphere and sense of substitution, it has a common fault of anti human operation. As the first condition of a game, it can make players play smoothly. In short, the advantages and disadvantages of Shangtian’s works are obvious. Therefore, many players buy the game without knowing it, which leads to the polarization of word-of-mouth, and the final sales volume can only be described as expected.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Use the whole body senses to enjoy an elegant performance, two and a half games of the poet Shangtian literati/d557a9ad0bf64bef95127768294492ab.jpg" alt="Use the whole body senses to enjoy an elegant performance, two and a half games of the poet Shangtian literati"><br>“The last guardian” Game Poster<br>Generally speaking, every concept of Shangtian’s game is very different. Although his game can’t be a blockbuster, it always belongs to a small part of people’s romance and even impresses the development of the game industry to some extent. The experience he brings to players is unprecedented. In 20 years, two and a half game works, each of which is a novel and unique feeling, will not conflict with each other, so that players can know who made the game as soon as they play. Now it’s nearly three years since the release of “the last guardian”. We are still in the position of the scholars who left Sony in the future. But at least one thing is certain that he will continue to write his elegant chapter with the game.</p>

    <title>Want you money, want you liver, gradually become the trend of the small pass charging mode</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/Want%20you%20money,%20want%20you%20liver,%20gradually%20become%20the%20trend%20of%20the%20small%20pass%20charging%20mode/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>On September 10, 2019, the wild escort ol finally ushered in a new round of major version updates, adding three different professions for players to choose, so that players can finally have extra things to do besides the confrontation mode, and these professions are relatively interesting. At the same time, a game service called “Wheeler Lawson club” has been updated in the game, which allows players to get experience value by participating in various activities. After accumulating a certain amount of experience, they can get various rewards free of charge.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Want you money, want you liver, gradually become the trend of the small pass charging mode/c57c616ea2eb42ec912d18fb3989bd51.jpg" alt="Want you money, want you liver, gradually become the trend of the small pass charging mode"><br>In addition to this free update service, players can also purchase an upgrade service named “the outside pass” by paying for an extra currency named “gold bar” in the game, which allows players to get an additional experience reward route, and can also accumulate experience to get additional reward content. This seemingly novel operation mode is not the first one created by the developer Rockstar, but it’s amazing that R-star has also begun to operate in this mode called “battle pass”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Want you money, want you liver, gradually become the trend of the small pass charging mode/ce16533005684cb4a54d89a6784bc5b9.jpg" alt="Want you money, want you liver, gradually become the trend of the small pass charging mode"></p>
<p>#The third payment revolution<br>“Battle pass” is called “battle pass” in Chinese. This name may not be unfamiliar to the players in the regular mixed e-game circle. This charging mode first appeared in MoBa game “dota2”. When the annual International Invitational Tournament (TI) begins, this kind of “battle pass” or “warrior warrant” or “interactive” will be launched in the play The upgrade service of “guide” is also known as “Ti notebook”.<br>The purpose of launching this service is to raise competition bonus for Ti competition. Every consumption of players in Ti book can raise 25% bonus for competition. At first, players can predict the trend of competition through this book. The more people they buy, the richer the reward, which means “crowdfunding”. Later, there is a rule of thumb in the book. Each level has different rewards. Players can not only spend more money to buy a higher level book, but also gain experience by doing tasks to upgrade the book. In short, if they buy a book, they will have to spend money as well as explode the liver. Usually most dota players will recharge the notebook for the reward attached to the high level of the notebook. For them, the content of these periods is directly proportional to the money they pay. I have to say that G Pang will still make money.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Want you money, want you liver, gradually become the trend of the small pass charging mode/8ec6d46dffd84958ab1831dd7f497082.jpg" alt="Want you money, want you liver, gradually become the trend of the small pass charging mode"><br>When it comes to the game that really promotes this charging mode, it is a group of black horses that no one thought of: Escape Game “Fortress night” produced by epic. The big escape mode of Fortress night is also a free game, but different from dota2, players can accumulate experience value of two rewards at the same time when playing for free. Free players can only obtain one of them named “silver”, but also accumulate experience for the reward of “gold”. Every player who buys a pass can obtain all previous experience The accumulated “gold” rewards are quite attractive for every player who has invested a lot of time in the game.<br>You know, the pass price in Fortress night is not high, but at that time, fortress night was in the most popular period, the number of players broke new highs repeatedly, and this kind of reward measure is very attractive. As long as some people are willing to pay out, they can make a lot of money for the game, and more people are willing to pay out than anyone imagined Much more, epic also made a lot of money, and the success of Fortress night is also known in the industry as “the third payment Revolution (the other two are the length and buyout system and the props charging system)”, which makes many manufacturers see red.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Want you money, want you liver, gradually become the trend of the small pass charging mode/133c3bc57b3e4bcc994ebab1d1bf19fb.jpg" alt="Want you money, want you liver, gradually become the trend of the small pass charging mode"><br>The items you can get after you pay are very rich<br>Very soon, the charging mode was spread like the infectious disease in the game field. Almost all the mainstream games with internal charges were added to this service, especially in the field of hand travel. The representative of Finland game company Supercell, the tribal conflict and the Royal war, joined the two category named “gold / Royal family”. Token’s passport service has enabled the game to create a new revenue record after years of operation, with revenue increasing by 155% in just one week.<br>The design of supercell’s pass is the same as that of Fortress night, but it has made some adjustments according to its own setting of being a mobile game and playing more leisure. It is more like a disguised member service, but the proportion of pass mode is larger. Looking back, many domestic manufacturers, such as “King’s glory” and “peace elite”, have the same charging mode. However, the pass price in these games is relatively high. They do not adjust according to the style of supercell at all, nor have the conscience of “Fortress night”, but directly refer to the mode of paying purchase level in “dota2” Charge.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Want you money, want you liver, gradually become the trend of the small pass charging mode/683840d9db474d9ab11780771770669e.jpg" alt="Want you money, want you liver, gradually become the trend of the small pass charging mode"><br>Gold token</p>
<h1 id="the-difference-between-a-thousand-times-for-one-person-and-a-thousand-times-for-one-person"><a href="#the-difference-between-a-thousand-times-for-one-person-and-a-thousand-times-for-one-person" class="headerlink" title="the difference between a thousand times for one person and a thousand times for one person"></a>the difference between a thousand times for one person and a thousand times for one person</h1><p>Why is it just a simple change of charging mode that can make the game so profitable? In fact, the mystery is very simple. Although there are many games charged with props in the domestic market, they have become popular in other countries in recent years. No matter at home or abroad, most of the game works with internal purchase elements are usually not very cheap in the impression of players, and the cheap content has no substantial impact on the experience itself, so they are playing for free There is usually a polarization in the play, either heavy krypton tycoon or zero krypton saltfish. The appearance of pass mode means that the overall charging standard of the game will be reduced, thus making the payment threshold of the game lower. After all, not all players’ spare money is so abundant. Therefore, lowering the threshold will also give many shy players a choice.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Want you money, want you liver, gradually become the trend of the small pass charging mode/46151821ab9340baa63de9cb0376b4e5.jpg" alt="Want you money, want you liver, gradually become the trend of the small pass charging mode"><br>Hierarchical membership is something many players don’t want to see<br>On the other hand, a large part of the reason why fortress night is so successful lies in its unique design of pass, which enables players to have a more intuitive understanding of what they can get. At the same time, there is no “pay 2 win” element in these contents, which are basically some ornaments and props that can only modify the appearance. The design of the pass can make all paying players stay on the same level. There is no difference between high and low. All the things that the players who pay for the pass get are the same. It’s just that who is more diligent to complete the task. Under this design, even the players who don’t have any desire to pay usually can’t help but appear, which makes the per capita consumption obvious After all, the increase of the game’s income is not only achieved by a few rich tycoons or player traffic, but also by making every player have the desire to pay for the game itself. In this way, there will be no dispute about krypton gold in the past for the players.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Want you money, want you liver, gradually become the trend of the small pass charging mode/5596c0611e5b43dc9c24d8bcf74fe9de.jpg" alt="Want you money, want you liver, gradually become the trend of the small pass charging mode"><br>Glory war order<br>    concluding remarks<br>In contrast, the pass used in the ol of the big escort in the wilderness can be called very conscientious. After all, the gold bars needed to buy the pass can be obtained through multiple channels in the game, and the price of the pass itself is not very expensive. It can be said that this time is a real compromise. After all, since the ol of the big escort has been online, the risk assessment has been bad, and the charging content is not good Over pricing has also been criticized by players. It can be seen that R star still has a lot of hope in this game. I hope that with this wave of “pass” wave, we can get a better future.</p>

    <url>/2019/11/08/What%20is%20life%20Gamification%20Is%20life%20a%20game/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>With the continuous improvement of the technical force of smart phones, it has become an indispensable existence in today’s society. You can buy things outside without carrying a wallet. You only need to take a car to pick up and send them when you go out, and you only need to place an order to send food to your home. With more and more functions of mobile phones, people’s lives are becoming more and more efficient and efficient. As a result, people will also rely on these functions.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/What is life Gamification Is life a game/d5c66071eefe47f3bbf40a124a8f24fe.jpg" alt="What is life Gamification Is life a game"><br>But I don’t know if you notice that we don’t know when our mobile wallet has an additional “points ranking”. Wechat will record your steps every day. Even the take out app often has small games that can win red envelopes. From a certain point of view, these contents seem to be “playing games” with people around you, which is not the same It’s a kind of illusion, but our daily life is becoming “Gamification”.</p>
<p>#What is Gamification?<br>Take the most typical example. As early as 2016, Alipay APP added a function called ant forest, which gained energy through daily consumption and walking steps, while stealing other people’s energy from other people’s forests and accumulating these energies. You can grow small trees in their “forests” into big trees and grow to a certain level. After that, Alipay will plant a real tree in the northwest under the name of the user.<br>In essence, this is a public welfare activity that promotes low-carbon and environmental protection, but in a comprehensive way, this activity is actually a very simple social games, and its purpose is to make a less attractive thing “interesting”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/What is life Gamification Is life a game/b9ad4cdef68041458b1856605fac5724.jpg" alt="What is life Gamification Is life a game"><br>In short, the so-called “Gamification” refers to the application of design ideas that often appear in video games to fields other than games. This concept is not emerging recently, but the concept of “Gamification” itself is earlier than the appearance of names. There are many examples that have been used in real life, such as the above ones. Now they mainly appear in most life apps.<br>Of course, it’s not only a game that can make an activity into a real game. For another example, a friend of the author goes back to a fast-food restaurant around his home every Thursday to buy hamburgers. The activity of this fast-food restaurant is to “buy any drink, send photos of the activity newspaper to the circle of friends and buy three hamburgers for ten yuan”. People can see this activity clearly It is nothing more than using the interpersonal relationship of customers to promote their own stores, but in essence, it is also a type of “Gamification”.</p>
<h1 id="characteristics-of-Gamification"><a href="#characteristics-of-Gamification" class="headerlink" title="characteristics of Gamification"></a>characteristics of Gamification</h1><p>Whether it’s video games or game products, no matter what type they are, they will have several same characteristics.<br>We all know that no matter in any video game, it will give the player a goal, so that the player has the motivation to play. The first characteristic of Gamification:   target.<br>Different types of games provide different goals for players, such as competitive games to pursue victory, leisure games to pass the time, social games to broaden people, or RPG Games to gain benefits.<br>Game products are no exception. Take my friend’s hamburger as an example. The goal of the game is to buy three hamburgers for ten yuan. The goal of the game is to allow customers to buy high-priced goods at a lower price. But before that, customers need to take action. This is the second feature of game: the   rule  .<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/What is life Gamification Is life a game/c8dec7eb77cb48b4ac0470b1889ebb98.jpg" alt="What is life Gamification Is life a game"><br>No one can resist the joy of explosive equipment<br>As the saying goes: there are no rules, not a circle. Since ancient times, any form of entertainment needs rules. Rules are a behavior reference in the game process. If there are no rules, there will be a situation where cheating is not uniform. When we were young, we often played a game of “gathering Qi and generating waves”. However, there was no uniform rule in this game. Therefore, the situation like “why do you gather Qi to generate waves and I die, but I gather Qi to hit you and you don’t die” happened from time to time. “Buy any drink, take photos of posters and send them to friends circle” is the rule of this game. So if we also buy drinks and take photos, we can show this dynamic to the waiter and have the qualification to buy hamburgers, and this dynamic is the third feature:   feedback  .<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/What is life Gamification Is life a game/ae93e45562344f8db57bc6c3fb9e40c2.jpg" alt="What is life Gamification Is life a game"><br>As we all know, in video games, the element of “strike sense” is a very metaphysical existence. The quality of “strike sense” varies from person to person. In different games, the response given by a slash on the enemy is also different. The “feedback” we have to say is not so metaphysical. For example, in CS, when someone shoots you, you can know how much blood you have lost. This is the feedback. It can be the information users need in the game, or the records of various behaviors of players. Taking photos and sending friends circle is like a task in the game. After sending, your task is finished. This dynamic is your proof.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/What is life Gamification Is life a game/60e1ee9f16d34970a97450c394a691a6.jpg" alt="What is life Gamification Is life a game"><br>There is such a ramen shop downstairs of the author’s house. Its slogan is: “it’s better to eat one thousand times than one thousand times”. The natural way to do business is to hope that your business can always be patronized. Similarly, the success of a game depends on whether it can retain players. In the past traditional RPG Games, we need better equipment to fight against powerful boss, while equipment needs to fight against monsters to explode. When you collect the equipment and defeat boss, you find that you need to fight against stronger boss, and you think that you need better equipment, so you fall into a cycle Players stick to their own games.<br>As for the above situation, even in such a favorable situation, if the hamburger is not delicious, the customer will not come again; and if the hamburger is delicious, plus such a high discount, it will give the customer a “value for money” feeling, so that the customer will come next time, and this is the last standard of the game products:   encouraging  . Combined with these features, it’s not hard to know why some people think it’s interesting to throw paper balls into the basket.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/What is life Gamification Is life a game/cb4fca05d1a54243a27de550b42b998f.jpg" alt="What is life Gamification Is life a game"><br>If it’s not fun to throw paper balls, why are there games?</p>
<h1 id="tail-the-meaning-of-Gamification"><a href="#tail-the-meaning-of-Gamification" class="headerlink" title="tail: the meaning of Gamification"></a>tail: the meaning of Gamification</h1><p>In the current mobile platform environment, mobile games are undoubtedly the most active in addition to daily social software, which is enough to prove the charm of video games. The purpose of the game itself is for entertainment, and the behavior of entertainment will not have a negative impact on people’s emotions, only for fun. In life, if a common thing is played as a game, the driving force will be improved. As the author said above, it can also make a very boring thing very interesting.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/What is life Gamification Is life a game/0ce1b5e320e14c3cbc160a070cf3a41b.jpg" alt="What is life Gamification Is life a game"><br>The earth ol is right beside you<br>Think about it carefully. Our life is like a large-scale online game. We are the protagonists in the game. By participating in various activities and learning various skills, we will improve one level every year. All the people around us are also players. This game has a high degree of freedom. You can even go anywhere on foot. Whether or not you commit a crime depends on yourself But this is a “death game”, life only once, no really No. Different from the game, you know from the beginning that the end of the game is death, but even so, we still have to fight without hesitation.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>When I was still at school, I usually had a habit of running to the audio-visual area of the mall not far from home after school to see if there were any new games. At that time, there was a game that left a deep impression on the author, not because of how excellent the game was or how attractive the theme was, but because there were almost all different versions of the game on the shelves at that time. The author didn’t know that there were documentaries and supplementary packages, but simply thought that this game was not the only one There are many versions, and the number is amazing.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Verify the theory of reality in the virtual world and simulate the glorious years of Maxis/2c489b5791144740a31419a008cd7dd6.jpg" alt="Verify the theory of reality in the virtual world and simulate the glorious years of Maxis"><br>When it comes to Maxis, many people may not have a more intuitive impression, and if you have played “Sims” or “Sims city” from their hands, you are equal to knowing the unknown company. In this era of “endless fun to fight with people”, the game of fighting and killing seems to be able to arouse the nature and desire of the players, with “extermination” and “victory” as the main core. However, the work of Maxis company is exactly opposite. He encourages the players to “create” and “operate” to make them unique in the whole game industry.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Verify the theory of reality in the virtual world and simulate the glorious years of Maxis/ea8ce843a0c04f108cf9211f46c94840.jpg" alt="Verify the theory of reality in the virtual world and simulate the glorious years of Maxis"></p>
<p>#A gamer of Architecture<br>Well Wright was born in Georgia in 1960. He has the same name as his father. When he was a child, he was very addicted to making models. According to his father, he enjoyed the feeling of making and creating things. It was his hobby that deeply influenced his future life. During his college years, will successively entered three universities. In the first two years, he was at Louisiana State University. After two years, he transferred to Louisiana Polytechnic University. His interest led him to study architecture and mechanical engineering. After two years at Polytechnic University, he went to the New College University in Manhattan, new York for one year. In these five years, through studying and learning the theories of different classmates, will has a different vision on the cognition of things, but in addition to learning, his favorite thing is no longer a robot, but a video game. Because of the emerging of the game industry in the 1980s, in its view, the interaction ability between video games and people is far more than that of robots, and can present more states, so he decided to join a new field with his own knowledge.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Verify the theory of reality in the virtual world and simulate the glorious years of Maxis/af1eacea25944ccf9caefaf0a212a5d6.jpg" alt="Verify the theory of reality in the virtual world and simulate the glorious years of Maxis"><br>Will Wright<br>Will Wright’s first game is called “raiding bagreen bay”, which is a flying shooting game overlooking the corner and landing on Commodore 64, a popular PC platform. However, the rise of the video game industry has made many people have an idea. Although the performance of the game itself is OK, but because of the rampant piracy, the income is affected. Will’s first game is not successful Not a failure, but at least he proved to the world that he can make a decent game. As for playing games, will has not forgotten to learn. Shortly after the first game was released, he became fascinated with Jay Forrest’s urban dynamics theory, such as urban planning, traffic construction, etc. combined with his previous experience in developing video games, he preferred to use these theories in the development editor to produce virtual scenes to verify these theories, and was making them On the way, will realized the problem: it seems to be a little bit interesting. It’s better to make this thing into a game. Someone will like it.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Verify the theory of reality in the virtual world and simulate the glorious years of Maxis/7469407d92e4478d8fc2db5117d7299e.jpg" alt="Verify the theory of reality in the virtual world and simulate the glorious years of Maxis"><br>Commodore 64</p>
<h1 id="chance-coincidence"><a href="#chance-coincidence" class="headerlink" title="chance coincidence"></a>chance coincidence</h1><p>Will modified the editor he used for self entertainment to make a decent game, named Sim City, and decided to sell it on Commodore 64 platform again. But Broderbund, the developer who worked with will before, was no longer willing to help him release the game, because the game didn’t win or lose in the traditional sense, or even There is no end, so the game that can’t play the end will not be liked by the developers. What if nobody sells it? In 1987, will met Jeff Braun, the investor who wanted to enter the game industry, at a party. They both liked Commodore 64 and had a topic. Will introduced his simulation city to him. Jeff was very optimistic about the game and decided to support it. They jointly founded Maxis company. Will plans to improve and strengthen his game, and make versions of multiple platforms to try to log in as many game platforms as possible, and finally it was released in 1989.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Verify the theory of reality in the virtual world and simulate the glorious years of Maxis/6f3320f4b53d472e8e8cee09ec7a8afe.jpg" alt="Verify the theory of reality in the virtual world and simulate the glorious years of Maxis"><br>1989 simulation city<br>At first, the game didn’t cause much sensation. As those publishers said, there are not many players who pay attention to the game, and the sales growth is very slow. Coincidentally, the game has been appreciated by time magazine of the United States. It introduces the game in a single page and editors’ opinions and comments on the game, most of which are positive. The influence of time magazine is indisputable. Although it only has one page, it really ignites the game industry, making the simulation city become the leader of the industry in an instant. Game sales suddenly exploded in a short period of time, known as one of the most influential games in history, and will Wright, who created the game, is also known as one of the “Godfathers of video games” of the year. But based on the success of simulation city, will also found the core of game development that may be really suitable for himself, namely “simulation (SIM)” and “creation”. So he decided to develop more simulation games. One of his ideas during his student period had the opportunity to practice: everything can be regarded as an abstract “model”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Verify the theory of reality in the virtual world and simulate the glorious years of Maxis/8c4c94c57aac428aa4621df230297226.jpg" alt="Verify the theory of reality in the virtual world and simulate the glorious years of Maxis"></p>
<h1 id="simulate-everything"><a href="#simulate-everything" class="headerlink" title="simulate everything"></a>simulate everything</h1><p>Subsequently, the company launched SimEarth, which can observe the evolution of life by changing the climate and environment, and simant, which can simulate the ecology and habits of ants to help their expanding forces to achieve self-defense, and simfarm, which has the same playing method as the simulation city, but is smaller but complete, and other works. Even now, the creativity of these works is very novel. In will’s own opinion, these works have some experimental properties, but these works can’t copy the success of “simulated city”. However, will is worth doing the same for “simulated city”. Who makes the design of this work have theoretical support? As far as the overall quality is concerned, the leading elder brother of “simulation city” is definitely the best one.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Verify the theory of reality in the virtual world and simulate the glorious years of Maxis/f75c3b4fbdc04fd7a6f1f717ca75bd64.jpg" alt="Verify the theory of reality in the virtual world and simulate the glorious years of Maxis"><br>1993 simulation farm<br>After several years of polishing and improvement, analog City ushered in his sequel. At that time, almost all products like to add “2000” after their names, so this work is also called “analog city 2000” naturally. Although the name is followed by a 2000, there were almost six years left in 2000. The picture of this work has been changed from a vertical top view angle to a 45 degree top view angle with more details, which has greatly improved both in the picture, the system and the content, making the ecology and operation in the city closer to the reality. The unexpected big sale of this work has also become the work of many modern players. Since then, a variety of game content expansion packages have emerged in endlessly, from furniture to architecture to script printing. This is the beginning of Maxis becoming a DLC maniac. But will’s ambition is not only there, they want to simulate many things, which can accept everything in the world, or even “life”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Verify the theory of reality in the virtual world and simulate the glorious years of Maxis/3b719e18d7094d668a2eaf72afa0c57a.jpg" alt="Verify the theory of reality in the virtual world and simulate the glorious years of Maxis"><br>1994 simulation city 2000</p>
<h1 id="the-Millennium-Finale"><a href="#the-Millennium-Finale" class="headerlink" title="the Millennium Finale"></a>the Millennium Finale</h1><p>The period from 1995 to 1997 can be said to be a low period for Maxis. After the launch of “simulation city 2000”, Maxis also tried to launch many more novel game styles, such as “simulation building”, “simulation helicopter”, “simulation Park” and many other works. Although each work is full of interest, compared with “simulation city”, it’s a bit of a small family These themes are almost all included in the simulation city. At the same time, “simulation helicopter” and the subsequent “simulation city street” as a driving simulation game, due to the unfamiliar with this type of game, the screen and system design are relatively backward, which is also a trial work of Maxis trying to develop 3D screen works, so the performance effect is very poor, far behind the same period of similar works. For a variety of reasons, the sales volume of these works is not ideal, and the introduction of too many works in a short period of time also makes Maxis lack inspiration, and even the internal finance is still a little nervous. In order to continue playing games, the company has to start to seek help from a gold owner.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Verify the theory of reality in the virtual world and simulate the glorious years of Maxis/931cca77a6e8418798da4d821b25f175.jpg" alt="Verify the theory of reality in the virtual world and simulate the glorious years of Maxis"><br>1996 simulation helicopter<br>In 1997, Maxis was acquired by American EA company for us $125 million. Ironically, Maxis and bullfrog, another well-known simulation business, were irreconcilable rivals. Now they are all under EA’s control and become “allies” in a special way. After entering EA, in EA’s view, the golden signboard of Maxis at that time was only “simulated city”, so Maxis was asked to produce another new work, and this work also sounded the clarion call for Maxis to enter a new era. At that time, integrity was close to the new millennium, so this play should be called “simulated city 2000”, but this name has been used, so what should we do? Simply add 1000, which is called “simulation city 3000”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Verify the theory of reality in the virtual world and simulate the glorious years of Maxis/c4bb94aaa11348f9b7df8aa0290c883d.jpg" alt="Verify the theory of reality in the virtual world and simulate the glorious years of Maxis"><br>1999 simulation city 3000<br>This work is only completed in one year, but it is amazing in detail. Although the picture is still 2D, Maxis has designed four views in different directions for each unit, which makes the game architecture be able to switch multiple angles for the first time. Although the finished product of the game is hard to be convincing. It’s a work completed in only one year. It’s highly certain that it can’t match the previous work, but it’s undeniable that he has indeed recovered the reputation of the company, and 5 million sets have temporarily stabilized his foothold in the new era.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Verify the theory of reality in the virtual world and simulate the glorious years of Maxis/ab50f24a4c984568a690377b083e0c9f.jpg" alt="Verify the theory of reality in the virtual world and simulate the glorious years of Maxis"></p>
<h1 id="“create-your-own-story”"><a href="#“create-your-own-story”" class="headerlink" title="“create your own story”"></a>“create your own story”</h1><p>However, this well-made game does not involve Will Wright. At the same time, he is busy with other things: will got inspiration from the early years’ production of “simulated ant”. Since he can reproduce an animal’s micro ecology in the game, why can’t he be a human micro society? We can maximize the perspective of simulation city, this time focusing on the tiny but indispensable existence of the city: people. Thus, the Sims, which simulates the lives of civilians, was born. It’s not so much a simulation game as a “family friendly” work. Players can create their own simulators in the game, who are responsible for taking care of all aspects of their food, clothing, housing and transportation. But we need to know what the simulation game of Maxis from the universe to the insects needs, and why is it so popular? Some people give the answer: Although Maxis’ works have many themes, this one is the most vivid one.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Verify the theory of reality in the virtual world and simulate the glorious years of Maxis/edd853b0fc6d43f394bf675e994160a1.jpg" alt="Verify the theory of reality in the virtual world and simulate the glorious years of Maxis"><br>2000 simulation life<br>After all, this time the game will bring players into the game, from managing cities to caring for simulated people, from macro to micro, from fraternity to specialization, so it can enable players to substitute more feelings. Compared with the original simulation business, the play method of simulation life is more like a leisure game. Players can build their own simulation people at will, or help the simulation people to dress up their home decoration freely to meet their daily needs, so that they can make money from their honest work and start their own business, or they can make trouble everywhere. The highly customized system and very comfortable playing method make this work gain nearly half of the female players in the overseas market, which is not hard to understand. After all, a game of changing clothes can attract numerous players, and the cultivation system contained in “simulation life” is not only changing clothes, it can be said to meet the psychological needs of female players to a large extent.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Verify the theory of reality in the virtual world and simulate the glorious years of Maxis/05c4a2b3cc7f4106a00a995f229ebab6.jpg" alt="Verify the theory of reality in the virtual world and simulate the glorious years of Maxis"><br>In will’s view, no matter what games the players are playing, it is a process of creating a story. Even though sometimes the players follow the plot’s guidance to make a choice, how to make a choice is still up to the players. Will just magnifies the feeling of creating a story and gives the players more rights to make their own choices. In many people’s view, this approach In many other games, for example, the game is open-source or provided with MOD or editor to encourage players to create on their own. In SIMS, these contents are completely made into the game, which is undoubtedly more intimate and friendly to the people than open-source. There are quite a lot of documentaries in SIMS. There are seven documentaries in the first generation of the series, and the price of each one is not cheap. Even at the end of the series, a version integrating all documentaries will be sold again, which makes Maxis officially become a DLC maniac.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Verify the theory of reality in the virtual world and simulate the glorious years of Maxis/df77b3f151114544a993a397081609d6.jpg" alt="Verify the theory of reality in the virtual world and simulate the glorious years of Maxis"><br>DLC quantity and price of Sims 3</p>
<p>#Flying to the universe<br>So far, Sims has launched four orthodox works and countless derivative works, and the number of supplementary packages is countless. Although players are reluctant to buy one after another, they can’t help buying one. Sims has also become one of the best-selling game works under EA, and the sales volume of the whole series can be comparable to my world. Since the company’s products are all available on a large scale or a small scale, will is thinking of creating a large-scale product. This time, they want to restore the whole process of a species from birth to reproduction and then to the establishment of civilization in a game, and the species will start to grow from the single cell stage, and even be able to broadcast their civilization to the whole universe in the later stage. This is an unprecedented grand idea. In 2005, will announced his work demonstration at the developer conference. In this game, players can customize the foreign trade and characteristics of species, and upload the customized foreign trade to the network to share with others. The game will contain a considerable number of stars for players to explore freely in the later space stage, It can be said that the final stage is the beginning of the game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Verify the theory of reality in the virtual world and simulate the glorious years of Maxis/c9c4e7466cfa4b0d84238e143451a3b3.jpg" alt="Verify the theory of reality in the virtual world and simulate the glorious years of Maxis"><br>The demo screen of the game in 2005 (it’s a long time ago, I can’t find a clearer source)<br>The game called “spore” took more than three years to develop. In order to fill the gap, Maxis even launched a new “Sims 2” which also contains more than ten documentaries. By 2008, when the game was officially launched, its own content was indeed as will showed at that time. There were five stages in the game, including cell, biology, tribe, civilization and space. But the first four stages of the game had a very short process and low playability. In the last stage of space, there were endless planets, but the playing method was very boring It’s not even as interesting as the very short stages of the previous processes. The creativity and design ideas of the game itself naturally have no problem, and the media also give a very objective medium and high evaluation for the work, but it seems that players’ expectations for the work are too high, resulting in a huge gap, so the reputation of the work in the players’ group is not good, but in the final analysis, it has nothing to do with the game itself.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Verify the theory of reality in the virtual world and simulate the glorious years of Maxis/2522596c09b04d84865f69e07bf454b5.jpg" alt="Verify the theory of reality in the virtual world and simulate the glorious years of Maxis"><br>Spores, 2008<br>    concluding remarks<br>This scene seems to be a familiar one. Players’ disappointment with “spore” has led to will Wright’s own scolding. However, wilwright did not choose to face it positively, but could not bear the pressure of public opinion. He left Maxis one year after the release of “spore” and even left the game industry strictly. For him, it seems that his creation The industry also reached a bottleneck, so it decided to retreat to the second tier and focus on the concept of “simulation” into daily life. Without will’s Maxis, it’s like a kite with broken line, without traction and goal. Their next works “dark spore” and “simulation city 5” failed to achieve good results because of their very bad game experience. After a while, EA announced that it would close Maxis headquarters, and only kept the SIM, the development group of “simulation life” based in the same area as ea headquarters S studio “and continue to launch the series” Sims “.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Verify the theory of reality in the virtual world and simulate the glorious years of Maxis/dcb16f4d206646969c0c648f23d5749e.jpg" alt="Verify the theory of reality in the virtual world and simulate the glorious years of Maxis"><br>It seems that Maxis, who has created countless splendors, is gone forever, but the classic works he brings to players will be remembered forever. Today, there are still many players who stick to the city or cottage they created many years ago, just as there are many people immersed in “heroes of the magic gate invincible 3”. For them, it’s not only because of their excellent quality, but also because they carry too many memories left in those years, and this beautiful memory is not It can be replaced at will through innovation.</p>

    <title>Where you want to go is not enough. What kind of game is high degree of freedom</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/Where%20you%20want%20to%20go%20is%20not%20enough.%20What%20kind%20of%20game%20is%20high%20degree%20of%20freedom/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Looking at the current 3A stand-alone works, it seems that with a huge map of the open world has become a standard configuration. We can explore the world through various ways provided in the game, and at the same time, we can do anything we want to do. For example, in the action game GTA, we can loot other passers-by’s vehicles at will, try to parachute between the buildings in the city, and drive the tank to bomb the streets. For the players, this kind of play is enough to let them fly.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Where you want to go is not enough. What kind of game is high degree of freedom/93f16e55a022438d8089a9e42768c7e8.jpg" alt="Where you want to go is not enough. What kind of game is high degree of freedom"><br>But many people can feel that although they can explore at will in these mainstream open world games and can do a lot of things, it seems that players can experience the game at will, but in fact, the freedom that can be provided for players in the game is far from being called “freedom”.<br>We may recall that in most open world games, they are usually divided into “task state” and “roaming state”. When undertaking tasks, most of the games can only be played according to the requirements given by the tasks, but the games that we really want to play at will can only be played outside the tasks. However, if we don’t do the tasks, we can’t advance the process of the game. So it seems that the Can the feeling of “leading the nose” really be called “freedom”?</p>
<p>#How to define high degrees of freedom?<br>The freedom of a game depends on the self orientation of the game. Take racing game as an example. If the playing method of the game is always a traditional racing game that only brushes circles in a fixed field, then obviously there is no freedom in the game. But if it is an open map, a race can not only drive smoothly according to the route, but also can break away from the open world racing game of how fast and how to open the track, then the freedom of the latter is obvious However, it is higher than the former; if on this basis, the user-defined modification system and collision system are added to allow players to install rain tires to the vehicle in sunny days, or directly crash the opponent to gain an advantage for themselves, then the playability can be upgraded to a higher level.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Where you want to go is not enough. What kind of game is high degree of freedom/373065498cae4b2996d1a4e2280b6e60.jpg" alt="Where you want to go is not enough. What kind of game is high degree of freedom"><br>It’s true that it’s OK to make a game with the first orientation, but compared with these examples, it’s obvious that the design of the last one should be more attractive. The playing method of racing game is nothing more than the posture vehicle flying on the road, neither flying nor launching, and if a game is made according to the above design, it can also be called “high degree of freedom”. All in all, the definition of freedom is not how open the game world is, but how many “options” can be provided to players. In terms of loading rain tires on a sunny day, it’s obviously meaningless to do so. Naturally, players will not be encouraged to do so in the game. However, the game only provides players with such conditions and gives them the right to choose. Whether or not to do so is completely the “freedom” of players, which is the expression of high degree of freedom.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Where you want to go is not enough. What kind of game is high degree of freedom/0c79671112014448877581b625edffe5.jpg" alt="Where you want to go is not enough. What kind of game is high degree of freedom"><br>Let’s take another look at other types of games on the market. Take action games for example. As mentioned above, most open world action games are seemingly free, but in fact, your every move is under the control of the game. For example, in GTA, when you do a task, you will be asked where to go, what to do, and how to do it. Players will always follow the guidance of the task, and if you don’t, the task will fail. Although the design of these tasks is wonderful and comparable to a blockbuster, all these are planned by the developers. The only free option provided by the game for the players is to choose what vehicles and routes they can take when they go to the task location.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Where you want to go is not enough. What kind of game is high degree of freedom/2d3ad0065f4f41de99ba7968fb7dc7f1.jpg" alt="Where you want to go is not enough. What kind of game is high degree of freedom"><br>GTA and its core lie in its wonderful task design and plot performance, which creates a high immersion experience for the players, while the content outside any task is only the core foil. Think carefully, the world of GTA is like a patchwork of many large and small linear checkpoints, because their story needs such a big world, so they did so In a big world, GTA’s freedom is not high.</p>
<h1 id="which-games-are-considered-as-“high-degree-of-freedom”"><a href="#which-games-are-considered-as-“high-degree-of-freedom”" class="headerlink" title="which games are considered as “high degree of freedom”?"></a>which games are considered as “high degree of freedom”?</h1><p>With the most easy to understand explanation, the so-called “high freedom game” is “a game with many choices”. One might ask, are text adventures or interactive movie games with only text or options free enough? When we dissect these games, the options provided to players in these games are all pre-designed processes by developers. Even though there are many kinds of options, they are still not separated from the developers’ planning. Therefore, the simple choice is not “high degree of freedom”. Of course, “choice” is not only reflected in the explicit aspect of letting players do the choice, but also in combination with different factors The type of game to determine the level of freedom.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Where you want to go is not enough. What kind of game is high degree of freedom/d89358dc268b4dbc9d3d8f00c03c62c8.jpg" alt="Where you want to go is not enough. What kind of game is high degree of freedom"><br>My favorite ARPG game “horse riding and killing” is a game with high degree of freedom. The game provides a rather complex character growth system for the players. What kind of character they want to become depends on the players’ own orientation. At the same time, the mission system of the game is very weak. If there is no “script” (game system, you can design the game stream by yourself In the case of Cheng), there are almost no tasks to talk about. Players can be soldiers who want to become stronger, or bandits who commit crimes everywhere. The whole game world is players’ playground, and they can play as they want. When they grow up to a certain extent, the whole game mode becomes a simulation operation or even a strategy game, which leads soldiers to attack cities To be a king of a country is not a dream.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Where you want to go is not enough. What kind of game is high degree of freedom/379a12cfcbfe4751a544c391ac8c1884.jpg" alt="Where you want to go is not enough. What kind of game is high degree of freedom"><br>The same design is also reflected in many old American RPG Games and nostalgic CRPG games, such as “door of Bode”, “radiation”, “divine kingdom” series, etc. these games also promote the game process by completing tasks, but usually only give players a goal, and how to do it needs players to explore.<br>For a simple example, you need to get a prop. The prop is locked in a room, and the key of the door is on an NPC. That’s all the information. You can choose to bribe NPC to give you the key, or kill NPC to get the key, or try to pry the door open, or smash the door directly, or even use props and skills to transfer yourself directly to the room. There are so many ways to carry out such a simple task, but the game will never provide suggestions and Guidance, how to proceed is entirely up to the player to choose.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Where you want to go is not enough. What kind of game is high degree of freedom/3ec6dc6af78f4012828e9fb41fe83ae9.jpg" alt="Where you want to go is not enough. What kind of game is high degree of freedom"><br>    concluding remarks<br>There are many other games like this. I won’t go over them one by one here. All these games have a common player because their system is deep enough to encourage the players to think independently, which is incomprehensible for the players who are used to playing simple and direct rough games. For them, deep thinking is a kind of torture.<br>This also reflects a phenomenon from the side: why do teenagers have rebellious period? One of the main reasons is that the elders give too few choices, sometimes even only one way to choose. This kind of rebellion, though not respected, can be understood, because the pursuit of diversity of choice is human nature, but also the nature of all creatures. From an evolutionary point of view, it’s because of the diversity of choices that life blooms such colorful fireworks.</p>

    <title>When the traditional style is not satisfied with the new formula, why is the word-of-mouth of ghost action breakpoint broken</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/When%20the%20traditional%20style%20is%20not%20satisfied%20with%20the%20new%20formula,%20why%20is%20the%20word-of-mouth%20of%20ghost%20action%20breakpoint%20broken/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>French Ubisoft’s annual 3A masterpiece “ghost action: breakpoint” has finally been released. Before its release, Ubisoft has spared no effort to put advertisements on various websites and commissioned many well-known video podcasts for publicity. Even in China, we can see many advertisements. Even many players who haven’t played this game may have heard of this game Name.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/When the traditional style is not satisfied with the new formula, why is the word-of-mouth of ghost action breakpoint broken/57a222d87e4f4a7e9df1ba3d84d3bc82.jpg" alt="When the traditional style is not satisfied with the new formula, why is the word-of-mouth of ghost action breakpoint broken"><br>Ubisoft did not provide the media with the first version of the evaluation this time, that is to say, all foreign media and players are games played on the same day, and the media’s evaluation of excellence is lifted one by one after the sale of the game. However, the evaluation of the game is not ideal, and most of the scores are still hovering at the passing line, until Now, the average media score of this work has fallen below the passing line, and the player’s score is even worse than qingyishui’s. it seems that this new work of Ubisoft really makes the players unbearable.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/When the traditional style is not satisfied with the new formula, why is the word-of-mouth of ghost action breakpoint broken/144ac47fbe5f486cb27f9cfdc60b6324.jpg" alt="When the traditional style is not satisfied with the new formula, why is the word-of-mouth of ghost action breakpoint broken"></p>
<p>#What’s the problem?<br>I was lucky enough to be selected to participate in the beta test of breakpoint. After all, as a series fan who directly bought the golden version of the previous work ghost action: wilderness, this opportunity will not be missed. Although the former work wilderness has been criticized by the players for a long time, and there are many problems in my opinion, I have experienced all the contents of the game completely and completely. Generally speaking, I can only get a general evaluation. At the same time, as a landscape party, Bolivia’s beautiful scenery can be the bonus of this work. The right is to The lowest cost is a self-help tour in Bolivia, which is also worth the game money.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/When the traditional style is not satisfied with the new formula, why is the word-of-mouth of ghost action breakpoint broken/2ac427d648e2451c86b84c1d95263ea4.jpg" alt="When the traditional style is not satisfied with the new formula, why is the word-of-mouth of ghost action breakpoint broken"><br>Ghost action: Wilderness<br>In the test of breakpoint, even as a fan, the author didn’t think how excellent the work was. Many people said that the beta test was the beginning of the experience game body, and the shaping and design of this part was quite good, but it made people feel that this generation has integrated the RPG element, that is, the popular “kill the strange and drop the equipment” , and as a tactical shooting game with emphasis on semi simulation, maybe this is the most unsuitable design for the “ghost action” series. Let’s put the combination of tactical shooting and RPG aside. Let’s talk about what else caused the players to be so angry. IGN, a well-known overseas media, scored a temporary score of 7 points for breakpoint on the day of its release, and gave such a comment: there are many progress systems in breakpoint that allow players to get rewards no matter what they do in the game, and the scenery in the game is also enjoyable. Players can defeat enemies in a completely free way when facing enemies in a stronghold.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/When the traditional style is not satisfied with the new formula, why is the word-of-mouth of ghost action breakpoint broken/1e2ea06ea6fa47ceaa3f3c738a4a53c9.jpg" alt="When the traditional style is not satisfied with the new formula, why is the word-of-mouth of ghost action breakpoint broken"><br>Ign provisional score<br>If the players who have played the previous work wilderness may feel a smile when they see this evaluation, which means that the game experience of this work is not much different from that of the previous work wilderness. What can be played in the beta test, even in the later stage of the official version, is also these contents, which is one of the biggest problems of this work: familiar “The flavor of Ubisoft”, combined with the system design problems mentioned before, the experience of this work is even worse than that of the previous work. According to the player evaluation integrated on foreign media metacritics, not only is it a very familiar taste in the game experience, but also bugs and bad optimization problems that can affect the normal experience of the game in the game keep the “Ubisoft features” as always, even more serious than previous works. Even the fairly high-end configuration will occasionally cause hardware crash. However, as a game with similar or even worse experience than the previous one, its price is much more expensive than the previous one. I believe no one can accept it like this, even if it is “another tour”, it’s also a bit worrisome.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/When the traditional style is not satisfied with the new formula, why is the word-of-mouth of ghost action breakpoint broken/fb6f634334f64ff0a170acf2b8ca2537.jpg" alt="When the traditional style is not satisfied with the new formula, why is the word-of-mouth of ghost action breakpoint broken"><br>Metacritical score</p>
<p>#New formula<br>One might say: isn’t this another “formula open world” game of Ubisoft? This is true, but not entirely. Breakpoint is really a “Ubisoft formula game”, but this time the formula is not the “formula game” we are familiar with before. From the early days of Assassin’s creed, open world, full of map collection elements, a large number of but highly repetitive branch tasks, as well as a story with a sense of substitution that is not too strong or even unclear who did what until customs clearance, all of these elements constitute the game style of Ubisoft in the next few years, no matter in action or shooting games. One advantage of doing so is that the quality of the game will be locked in a horizontal range, which saves effort and time. The factors that can make the horizontal line float are whether the plot is brilliant and whether the game is high enough. The disadvantage of doing so is that all games are playing the same way, so even different categories and IP will soon be boring, and this design will not be able to create a “masterpiece” level game that can rank among the industry benchmarks.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/When the traditional style is not satisfied with the new formula, why is the word-of-mouth of ghost action breakpoint broken/ef163f8f514b41b4b58c231bcecf3037.jpg" alt="When the traditional style is not satisfied with the new formula, why is the word-of-mouth of ghost action breakpoint broken"><br>“Assassin’s Creed: the great revolution” this map is really scary<br>In the first few years, Ubisoft’s several games suffered from this “formulaic” design. They also realized that they should make some adjustments. The first “mouse” they tested was Ubisoft’s latest IP “whole territory blockade” in recent years. This work applies the “Tom Clancy” type of aerial setting, and adds the RPG elements on the basis of the aerial realistic war theme. Although the design of shooting and RPG is not the first one by Ubisoft, the whole territory blockade is undoubtedly the largest and the most refined one in the design of pictures and scenes. “Blockade of the whole territory” has become the best-selling single work of Ubisoft for many years. With various problems encountered in the first launch, the first attempt to MMO online games also highlights their inexperience, but the game is successful, but this seems to make Ubisoft aware of the feasibility of this design, so RPG system seems to be the “golden oil” in Ubisoft’s eyes, so Ubisoft also The “new formula” has been found.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/When the traditional style is not satisfied with the new formula, why is the word-of-mouth of ghost action breakpoint broken/44c754d7fa8c4cd880f504a573ab4059.jpg" alt="When the traditional style is not satisfied with the new formula, why is the word-of-mouth of ghost action breakpoint broken"><br>RPG numerical design of “whole territory blockade”<br>In the next few years, “Assassin’s Creed: Origin”, “Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey” and “whole territory blockade 2”, all of these games, without exception, have achieved a double harvest of reputation and sales volume (whole territory blockade 2 is set off by peers to some extent). When it was released, “origin” was even evaluated as “another peak work of Assassin’s Creed many years later”, so we do not It’s hard to see that the combination of various categories and RPG system has formed a new chemical reaction. The previous “formula design” has been removed some elements, and at the same time, it is open to accept the RPG content. With the addition of RPG elements, not only the playability of the game can be increased, but also the freedom of the game can be improved. Undoubtedly, the design of “striking strange and exploding clothes” and talent and skills are in the process at the same time There are many weaknesses of players. These contents are the source design that can bring “pleasure” and “play impulse” to players. In addition, these IPS are also suitable for making RPG Games, so it is expected that they will succeed.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/When the traditional style is not satisfied with the new formula, why is the word-of-mouth of ghost action breakpoint broken/8b4d3a8f98e44de6914583b2ef727cb2.jpg" alt="When the traditional style is not satisfied with the new formula, why is the word-of-mouth of ghost action breakpoint broken"><br>Assassin’s Creed: origin<br>However, the best match is always the best match for experiments. The ghost action, which is mainly about stealth tactical shooting, is obviously not as good as RPG. “Ghost action” emphasizes that many people can cooperate in tactics, such as “synchronous shooting” and role division. Even if there is no online player, there are also AI teammates to provide assistance, which is one of the core of the series for many years. In breakpoint, if not online, only the player is alone. Although RPG element is introduced in breakpoint, as long as the enemy does not wear a helmet or mask, it is still “dead with a bang”, and the delay design of triggering the alarm is very slow. Most of the time, sneaking becomes unnecessary. The previous concept of “tactical shooting” can be thrown away, just aiming at the head It’s easy.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/When the traditional style is not satisfied with the new formula, why is the word-of-mouth of ghost action breakpoint broken/961de204264a4b16a918364858caf6a9.jpg" alt="When the traditional style is not satisfied with the new formula, why is the word-of-mouth of ghost action breakpoint broken"><br>So where does the RPG element stand out? As the author said above, “kill the strange equipment”, players need to check the items column to replace new equipment, but in fact, no matter what gun is shot dead, so the RPG equipment design becomes meaningless. In short, the ambition of breakpoint is very strong. They have integrated a lot of content into this work, but finally made a “four not like” out, which not only lost the characteristics of the original “ghost action”, but also did not have any other characteristics that can be highlighted, resulting in offending the old players, and the new players have no desire to try.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/When the traditional style is not satisfied with the new formula, why is the word-of-mouth of ghost action breakpoint broken/0f1be916553c4c21a77c2082a8f9f951.jpg" alt="When the traditional style is not satisfied with the new formula, why is the word-of-mouth of ghost action breakpoint broken"><br>Concluding remarks<br>In contrast, wilderness, which was not well-known at the beginning, has become a masterpiece, which is ironic. The quality of the game is so bad. I’m sorry for the huge publicity and the expensive price of the game. Just like the original whole territory blockade, Ubisoft imagines everything is too good. They think that the players will perform the dark zone drama in the promotional film, but in fact, there are only endless killing and being killed. So is breakpoint, such as life The introduction of storage system and RPG system, but in the game, these designs are virtual. They view their games with high expectations, but the players are not as naive as he imagined.</p>

    <title>Who is the winner in the game of asymmetric confrontation</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/Who%20is%20the%20winner%20in%20the%20game%20of%20asymmetric%20confrontation/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>In today’s mainstream competitive games, it is usually 5v5 mode. Only a few games may be 6v6 or even many. The biggest advantage of both sides of the competition using the same number of people is fairness. After all, for competitive games, there is nothing more important than fairness. With the passage of time, people’s thinking began to diverge, the mode of competitive games became more and more mature, and the topic was shifted back to the number of opponents.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Who is the winner in the game of asymmetric confrontation/f698f6216107469ab5e8908ce7b4894e.jpg" alt="Who is the winner in the game of asymmetric confrontation"><br>It has been assumed that if the number of confrontations is changed to one to many, but at the same time this person is given the ability to equal the number of the other party, then this is a different form of balance. In this way, the game concept of “asymmetric confrontation” was born. And the games derived from this concept have begun to appear in the game market one after another. Although they are very novel and interesting, few works seem to maintain strong vitality.</p>
<h1 id="rules-that-already-exist"><a href="#rules-that-already-exist" class="headerlink" title="rules that already exist"></a>rules that already exist</h1><p>In fact, the game rule of asymmetric confrontation is not just emerging in recent years, and it was not originally used in the field of video games, but was born in the military field. In 1991, a report called “joint operations of the armed forces of the United States” proposed a form of “asymmetric operations”, which refers to the use of different forces on both sides of the battle, such as air force to Navy, air force to army, army to Navy, etc., which are unbalanced in information, capability or combat resources and utilized during the war Environmental elements are the effect of “arms restraint” for our side, so as to occupy more advantages and reduce the consumption of resources. Asymmetric operations emphasize flexible rules of engagement, organization, operational theory or equipment to implement operations safely and effectively.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Who is the winner in the game of asymmetric confrontation/c2b3ae41d4e04bbd81ab453e108e9a46.jpg" alt="Who is the winner in the game of asymmetric confrontation"><br>It is the same in the field of games. The resources of both sides are not functional, and their interaction mode, rules and ultimate goal are totally different. The concept of non confrontation has been used in the field of games for a long time. For example, the most popular and popular chess and card game “fight the landlord” is the mode of asymmetric confrontation. One of the three players is the landlord, and the other two are the peasants. ; one of the two peasants can take the lead in escaping the cards in hand and win, and the two peasants can win with mutual help; the landlord can get additional cards to help him form a better card type and more efficient escape card. The former relies more on individual ability, while the latter relies more on team work.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Who is the winner in the game of asymmetric confrontation/cf791b4a92284bf381f07164273809df.jpg" alt="Who is the winner in the game of asymmetric confrontation"><br>    misunderstanding<br>In fact, it is not that there is only a difference in the number of people on both sides, even if it is an asymmetric confrontation, the number of people is only one of the elements in the asymmetric game, and there are many asymmetric games that do not have a difference in the number of people. Many SLG games on the mobile platform usually adopt the game playing method of building and cultivating. Players need to build their own camp while cultivating their forces. The forces are used to attack other people’s camp to obtain more resources to build the camp. The purpose of building the camp is to resist the invasion of other players. The mode of the game breaks down. In essence, it’s a 1v1 game. The attackers need to arrange troops to try to break through, while the defenders need to try their best to resist the attacks of the attackers. Although the number of players is the same, the game modes of both sides are quite different. Different ways of playing mean different ideas in the process of the game. The attackers can choose to attack at any time and how many troops to attack, while the defenders can only be prepared before the battle begins.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Who is the winner in the game of asymmetric confrontation/0dd521a0fd574b608fab12c6079bf30c.jpg" alt="Who is the winner in the game of asymmetric confrontation"><br>In addition to the differences in game mechanism, there are also differences in game rules, such as the “cart” mode in “Legion Fortress 2” and “watch the vanguard”, which is also based on the same number of players. One side of the cart only needs to drive other enemies to the target point to win, while the defense side needs to do its best to block the progress of the other side and stick to the turn time End. In contrast, like the SLG game mentioned above, the average battle time and frequency of the defensive side in a round are much higher than that of the offensive side, so it is obviously not fair to rely on only one round to determine the victory and defeat. It is necessary to join multiple rounds at a time, and the positions of the two sides also need to be exchanged between each round, so that both sides have the possibility of scoring, even if they swim The rules of the play are asymmetric in themselves, but on the whole they are quite fair.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Who is the winner in the game of asymmetric confrontation/1af0b86202ef406599cd0a7c03ae60e6.jpg" alt="Who is the winner in the game of asymmetric confrontation"></p>
<h1 id="lessons-from-the-past"><a href="#lessons-from-the-past" class="headerlink" title="lessons from the past"></a>lessons from the past</h1><p>Although there are not many game works adopting this concept, it is precisely because of this that each of these games is catchy. The representative work in the early years has created the anti terrorist elite ol with “biochemical upsurge” for the following FPS online games. The biochemical mode contained in ol is a model of asymmetric confrontation. The players’ life value is very low and the damage is not high, but the number of players is large and they can use firearms, while the infected ones are high in damage, but the number of people is small and they can only use melee attack. In most cases, an infected person can transform a survivor into an infected person with only one stroke. Therefore, the rule of the game is that the infected person will transform all the survivors, or the survivors will kill all the infected persons. In this condition, the cooperation between the survivors is more and more needed. Otherwise, under such harsh conditions, the whole army will be easily annihilated.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Who is the winner in the game of asymmetric confrontation/e3fa64170fa0439eb860c1ee896b931c.jpg" alt="Who is the winner in the game of asymmetric confrontation"><br>Later, there are many one-to-many horror survival games on the market, such as “dawn killing machine”, “Friday the 13th” and “the fifth personality”. Because it is a terror game, the core of the game is not fighting but survival. The survivors just need to escape the monster as soon as possible, while the players who play the monster have different abilities to cope with it These survivors are not so much a survival game as a “hide and seek” game (the later hide and seek mode is the same). The author would like to focus on a piece of work here. He was once called “the pioneer of asymmetric confrontation game” by players. Unfortunately, the game has stopped serving now. Although he tried to save the situation, he failed to avoid the fate of death. This game is evolution.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Who is the winner in the game of asymmetric confrontation/1c46cb0df2b24d3fab4a7629c71a995b.jpg" alt="Who is the winner in the game of asymmetric confrontation"><br>Evolution is a 3A level multi player online asymmetric confrontation FPS game produced by turnlerock studio and released by 2K. In the process of the game, one player plays a monster and four players play a hunter to fight. Monsters have no ability to compete with four hunters at the same time in the early stage, so they need to constantly devour other small animals to strengthen their own evolution, so that they can grow from a small monster to a big monster, and whoever is defeated first will lose. It seems that the game itself has an excellent system and playing method, but the real fatal element is the balance of the game. The players who play four hunters have different roles and occupations, so the whole game needs four players to cooperate closely. If the team is organized, the threshold of the game will rise to a stage. After all, not everyone can easily master the playing methods of four different occupations, so the fault tolerance rate of hunters will become low, and the game experience of the team is very poor. In most cases, passers-by players are all Unable to open voice to communicate with each other, thus forming a rather bad game environment, thus dissuading one player after another.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Who is the winner in the game of asymmetric confrontation/6a802e5858184738bdc3c7866aba8108.jpg" alt="Who is the winner in the game of asymmetric confrontation"><br>    concluding remarks<br>Even though evolution was later changed to free operation, it still failed to solve this problem fundamentally. To be clear, it was because the game’s playing method was too novel and lacked all-round consideration and design. However, the failure of evolution inspired many later common games. Instead of fighting each other, it was better to directly remove the fighting elements, which made these later residents The games on have all been successful. However, even now, if a non adversary game does not have continuous and stable content update and balance adjustment, then its own playing method is relatively simple, and asymmetric confrontation is likely to die at any time.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Who is the winner in the game of asymmetric confrontation/feea3f0d672b4aec8813c5e58ee22fb3.jpg" alt="Who is the winner in the game of asymmetric confrontation"><br>The failure of evolution is enough to explain everything, and there are few games that can really do this, which is why this mode has not been able to fully fire. This is a very potential game model that needs to be improved and developed. I hope to see more excellent game works in the future.</p>

    <title>Who says the horror games on mobile phones are not scary Teddy Bear perfectly interpreting the theory of horror Valley</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/Who%20says%20the%20horror%20games%20on%20mobile%20phones%20are%20not%20scary%20Teddy%20Bear%20perfectly%20interpreting%20the%20theory%20of%20horror%20Valley/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Horror game, a game type that most players are familiar with and unfamiliar with, basically as long as it is not limited to a few games, players can list one or two, but few players are really willing to try. Most people’s understanding of the horror game is only obtained from the video or live broadcast on the Internet, and the viewers are always interested in the fact that the host is frightened by the plot in the game. Although the horror game is small, almost every quarter we can see one or two works go on sale, among which there are some works with excellent production and excellent plot, of course, there is no depth to speak of, just for the scary game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Who says the horror games on mobile phones are not scary Teddy Bear perfectly interpreting the theory of horror Valley/3af638f86420405d93bf18a7c86d43f4.jpg" alt="Who says the horror games on mobile phones are not scary Teddy Bear perfectly interpreting the theory of horror Valley"><br>Layer upon layer fear 2 with both literary and artistic atmosphere and fear<br>Terrorist games are not only active in PC and host platforms, but also one of the most vital ways to log in to the huge mobile platform. Since many horror games have been launched on the mobile end, we can obviously see that the activity level of horror Games has increased a lot. In the discussion circle of horror games on the mobile end, it is often said that the experience of horror games on the mobile end is far less than that of PC or console platform, which is not unreasonable, but it does not mean that all horror games on the mobile platform are active “Not scary enough.”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Who says the horror games on mobile phones are not scary Teddy Bear perfectly interpreting the theory of horror Valley/f3979784c4d948cd923e439e48be2b20.jpg" alt="Who says the horror games on mobile phones are not scary Teddy Bear perfectly interpreting the theory of horror Valley"><br>On the level of production excellence, lost within is definitely among the best</p>
<p>#Why don’t horror tour scare people?<br>For mobile platforms, being limited by hardware means that they will be greatly reduced in the sense of substitution first. If a horror game wants to frighten the players, it must create a good sense of presence for the players, but the screen of the mobile platform is too small compared with the PC platform. No matter how good the picture quality is, the details of the scene in the game are hard to be noticed by the players, and it is even possible for the players to jump out of the game itself and pay attention to things outside the game or the surrounding environment, so that they are extremely concerned It’s possible to ignore the producer’s in-game plot for the player to prepare for fear.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Who says the horror games on mobile phones are not scary Teddy Bear perfectly interpreting the theory of horror Valley/c545f65e857b49f6ba1b4d482fb21c5a.jpg" alt="Who says the horror games on mobile phones are not scary Teddy Bear perfectly interpreting the theory of horror Valley"><br>In escape, there are many designs to increase the sense of crisis for players<br>Of course, it’s not that the screen is the only indicator to create the atmosphere. The sound effect and music in the game are also one of the general methods to enhance the sense of terror. As we all know, if all the sound effects of the game are turned off when playing horror games, it will be a devastating damage to the thrilling atmosphere in the game. In the same way, it’s hard to imagine a person sitting in a noisy fast food restaurant and playing terror games with his mobile phone. If he doesn’t play in a quiet environment, the role of music and sound effects in creating atmosphere can’t be played.<br>Anyone who knows how to play, whether on the mobile platform or on the PC host platform, will choose a person to enjoy it quietly. Imagine if you are playing a horror game while your family is playing a drama on TV. Do you still have the mind to concentrate on the game? The author’s habit is to turn off the light and play in the bed before going to bed. The advantage is that it can double the sense of terror to make the experience better, and the disadvantage is that it may be too exciting to sleep.</p>
<h1 id="“if-you-think-it’s-scary-it’s-more-scary-for-you”"><a href="#“if-you-think-it’s-scary-it’s-more-scary-for-you”" class="headerlink" title="“if you think it’s scary, it’s more scary for you”"></a>“if you think it’s scary, it’s more scary for you”</h1><p>Scott Coulson is an independent game producer with two children. He has developed more than 30 games, but no one is interested in them all the time, which made him very depressed for a time and had no direction for the development of games. In December 2013, Scott developed a small leisure game for children, “chiper and son wood company”, and the players’ comments made Scott intolerable. Netizens commented that the characters in the game were really frightening, just like horrible video dolls, which broke Scott’s heart. It was very strong that he wanted to quit the game development industry this time.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Who says the horror games on mobile phones are not scary Teddy Bear perfectly interpreting the theory of horror Valley/53e790aae0b6447486236ce13726cdc1.jpg" alt="Who says the horror games on mobile phones are not scary Teddy Bear perfectly interpreting the theory of horror Valley"><br>Just as Scott was sulking in the quilt, I don’t know why a strange thought suddenly occurred: since you say my game is frightening, I’ll try a more frightening one for you. After half a year’s development, in 2014, the horror game “five nights at Freddy’s (fnaf)” with the theme of “Teddy Bear video Doll” was born.<br>When the game first entered the Steam, it had to be Tucao. The Chinese translation of the Chinese name was too strange. It was once thought that it was a game of otaku. This game gave people a very rough feeling at first glance. The resolution of the picture was very low, just like the game screen of the 80s and 90s of last century.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Who says the horror games on mobile phones are not scary Teddy Bear perfectly interpreting the theory of horror Valley/fdd9e64e3c1c48038efde705045f041e.jpg" alt="Who says the horror games on mobile phones are not scary Teddy Bear perfectly interpreting the theory of horror Valley"><br>It’s not scary to look at, but I’m sure kids don’t like it<br>The story of the game takes place in a pizza shop. The player plays a security guard in the game. He is on duty from midnight to 6am to be responsible for the security of all the computer properties. The selling point of this pizza shop is that it is equipped with machine dolls that attract children. However, these machine dolls are all attached to the dead children. Every midnight, they will act on their own to attack the protagonist , what the player has to do is resist these dolls and survive in five nights. The introduction looks like a tower defense game, but in fact, the operation is very simple. What players can do in the game is just to stay in the security room to watch and monitor the dolls, and use the electronic door of the monitoring room to block the dolls outside. In addition, players can do nothing.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Who says the horror games on mobile phones are not scary Teddy Bear perfectly interpreting the theory of horror Valley/fb39303b22a04f188a99011f01eb071b.jpg" alt="Who says the horror games on mobile phones are not scary Teddy Bear perfectly interpreting the theory of horror Valley"><br>There will be more rooms and roads every day. If you don’t observe, you can’t know the route<br>In the past horror games, players can usually explore in various scenes and interact with various things to trigger the sense of terror. There are so many games like fnaf, let alone the rough production of fnaf, which doesn’t seem very scary. In fact, in order to create the best sense of horror for the players, all kinds of designs in the game are intentional.<br>First of all, players can’t move or explore. They can only use the monitoring to observe the situation outside the monitoring room. Those machine dolls are wandering outside. If you don’t use the monitoring, you can’t predict when they will attack. If you use the monitoring, power consumption will be accelerated. If the power is exhausted, you can’t start the electronic door used to block dolls. The electronic door is the only one for players For the means of self-defense, if there is no power, players can only choose to sit and wait for death (there is no picture of jumping and killing below, please read it with ease).<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Who says the horror games on mobile phones are not scary Teddy Bear perfectly interpreting the theory of horror Valley/0a9c6887f17746c8908f31d25ee0c222.jpg" alt="Who says the horror games on mobile phones are not scary Teddy Bear perfectly interpreting the theory of horror Valley"><br>If the response is not timely or there is no power, the next second is the game over</p>
<p>#The valley of terror theory<br>In 1969, Japanese robot expert Mori Changhong put forward a theory: when robots and humans are similar to each other to a certain extent, human response to them will suddenly become extremely disgusted, that is, even if there is a little difference between robots and humans, it will be very conspicuous and dazzling, so the whole robot has a very stiff and horrible feeling, like facing the line The corpse walks the meat.<br>The higher the simulation degree of humanoid toys or robots is, the better people will feel, but when it exceeds a critical point, this kind of good feeling will suddenly decrease, and the more like people, the more disgusted they are with fear, until the bottom of the valley, which is called the valley of terror. The term “valley of terror” was put forward by Ernst kinch in his 1906 paper psychology of the valley of terror. It was elaborated in the famous psychopsychologist Freud’s paper “valley of terror” in 1919, which became a famous theory.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Who says the horror games on mobile phones are not scary Teddy Bear perfectly interpreting the theory of horror Valley/25ef398dfa6141329d12c44b809b3162.jpg" alt="Who says the horror games on mobile phones are not scary Teddy Bear perfectly interpreting the theory of horror Valley"><br>In fnaf, Scott uses this point flexibly. In the whole process of the game, the players are always in a passive state. The actions of several dolls are excessively personified, as if they are playing by the nose of several dolls, which makes the players have fear and resistance psychology. This fear is not sudden, but continuous.<br>At the same time, in this passive situation, the players have to face the instinctive “fear of the unknown” of human beings and the gradually reduced sense of oppression of electricity. Combining these elements together, the sense of terror brought by them can not even be matched by many large-scale terror games. The game received unprecedented praise after logging into PC platform, and was transplanted to mobile platform after that. Even after several months, it has been at the top of download list.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Who says the horror games on mobile phones are not scary Teddy Bear perfectly interpreting the theory of horror Valley/f729e6d8ff714570bcb202de2e468d55.jpg" alt="Who says the horror games on mobile phones are not scary Teddy Bear perfectly interpreting the theory of horror Valley"><br>Dolls are not terrible, only when they are haunted<br>Compared with other horror games, rough production has become the feature of fnaf. It doesn’t need much beautiful pictures or high-quality music. The fear he brings to the players is from the inside out, not imposed by the game. Just look at the game mode, fnaf obviously needs to be more suitable for mobile platforms. The operation of the game itself is not complicated just by clicking. If the game is played in the way I mentioned above, it can stimulate more effects than the PC (it is recommended not to try it really).<br>    concluding remarks<br>In addition to the exquisite design of the game playing mode, the game also uses the fragmented narrative similar to silent mountain, which paves a hidden story by adding various details and weird hidden plots in the scene. The story is called “87 bite”, which is a fictitious urban legend in the game. Please find the specific plot by yourself. There is no need to repeat it here, but you need to know something Yes, no one is not interested in urban legends, which is one of the reasons why the series of games are passed on by the players orally. The subculture products derived from the games are also emerging in an endless stream.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Who says the horror games on mobile phones are not scary Teddy Bear perfectly interpreting the theory of horror Valley/247f6e3f2cd94d069122eecc75707326.jpg" alt="Who says the horror games on mobile phones are not scary Teddy Bear perfectly interpreting the theory of horror Valley"><br>So far, “fnaf” series has launched six works, each generation’s style is different, but the sense of fear is the same. “Fnaf” relies on its own unique style, so that people can see the hope that horror games can also be popular. Fnaf has proved to the players that if the characteristics of the mobile terminal are fully considered in the design and the terror atmosphere is rendered by using various functions of the mobile phone, good products can also be created. It is not that the effect of terror games on the mobile phone is not good, but that most games do not bring the fun the players want.</p>

    <title>Why did the spiritual successor of Diablo, who was supposed to be a thriving company, get disbanded</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/Why%20did%20the%20spiritual%20successor%20of%20Diablo,%20who%20was%20supposed%20to%20be%20a%20thriving%20company,%20get%20disbanded/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Ten years ago, independent games were in a period of rapid development. Many well-made creative and novel works came out in the upper class of the market, and it was also the most popular period of independent games. There were also relatively excellent and topical works on the market. In my early years, I loved Blizzard’s many works, especially Diablo 2 and Warcraft 3. However, Diablo 2 has been the game of 2000. People always expect Blizzard to publish the new works of Diablo as soon as possible.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Why did the spiritual successor of Diablo, who was supposed to be a thriving company, get disbanded/3252df4a74374d4cb5821ee2b50270b5.jpg" alt="Why did the spiritual successor of Diablo, who was supposed to be a thriving company, get disbanded"><br>At this time, an independent game called “torch light” appeared in the vision of the players. At first glance, it has excellent quality. The developer of this game, runic games, was founded by the original “father of darkness”. He also participated in the development of this game. With this name as a signboard, this game soon became a black horse in 2009. In principle, since the company has such a good reputation, the game should sell well, and the company should have a lot of money, but it’s amazing that the company was dissolved two years ago, leaving only their works for later players to continue to enjoy.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Why did the spiritual successor of Diablo, who was supposed to be a thriving company, get disbanded/76747b0763f843a8b1b76f59c49899e4.jpg" alt="Why did the spiritual successor of Diablo, who was supposed to be a thriving company, get disbanded"></p>
<h1 id="“we’re-going-to-do-Diablo-”"><a href="#“we’re-going-to-do-Diablo-”" class="headerlink" title="“we’re going to do Diablo.”"></a>“we’re going to do Diablo.”</h1><p>Players who know something about Blizzard should know that in the early years, blizzard had an external studio named flagship, which was specially responsible for developing various high-quality games. Most of Blizzard’s works were developed by them, while Diablo series was full name operated by them. Without them, there would be no Diablo Achievements now. Unfortunately, due to the rising development cost of the game over time, and the lack of awareness of authenticity among players in the early years, the talented studio had to close down due to economic problems. The internal members of the studio are divided into several teams, and the members of each team have established relatively good feelings and tacit understanding with each other. When the studio announced its closure, they were also at a loss, and one of the teams, Travis baudrilly, was unwilling to separate from his colleagues, so they once again gathered 14 people in the team and established runic games together with Max scayf, the “father of darkness”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Why did the spiritual successor of Diablo, who was supposed to be a thriving company, get disbanded/a0471b3041db4b4a966b44331626b583.jpg" alt="Why did the spiritual successor of Diablo, who was supposed to be a thriving company, get disbanded"><br>After the establishment of the new studio, the company didn’t have a clear goal for about two months. Now that the game studio has been set up, how can we say that we should continue to play games? At that time, they were already independent studios, so what kind of game to play became a puzzle for them to think about. After several discussions, they decided to make an ARPG similar to Diablo, which is what they are good at. At the same time, they also want to make another such game. Considering that there has been no such kind of works for a long time since Diablo 2, and the random map system which plays a great role in Diablo 2 rarely reappears They decided to polish all the highlights and advantages they thought of when they made Diablo 2, and try to make a better quality work. This work is the light of the torch of the early generation, and it took only 11 months to make a very good demo.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Why did the spiritual successor of Diablo, who was supposed to be a thriving company, get disbanded/3fe0ff3c09064fe8b2d5161630e52db6.jpg" alt="Why did the spiritual successor of Diablo, who was supposed to be a thriving company, get disbanded"></p>
<p>#The light of the torch<br>Only years of cooperation experience can make this not too large team to produce such a high degree of completion in such a short time. For the development of this game, the members of the whole team have reached a complete consensus, which is the so-called “work hard and think hard”. However, no matter how complete the game is, it can’t be called “official version”. After all, it’s still a demo. There’s no way, because their capital has bottomed out. What they need now is not to continue to find ways to polish the game, but to find a investor to relieve the economic pressure as soon as possible. At this time, the game has been released to the Internet to start “preemptive experience” 。<br>They have visited big fish, a leading us EA company, and even Microsoft, which makes gambling games, but they are all turned away for various reasons. Compared with their games, they want the talents of this studio. At the same time, perfect world (also called perfect time and space at that time) was a free asset of domestic manufacturers. They needed more technical support to operate different games. So they took a fancy to runic, understood their situation, and bought most shares of runic at a price of 8.4 million dollars. Finally, they were able to complete and release the official version of torch light.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Why did the spiritual successor of Diablo, who was supposed to be a thriving company, get disbanded/fff7e93bb4c149798b97c76f1d96c368.jpg" alt="Why did the spiritual successor of Diablo, who was supposed to be a thriving company, get disbanded"><br>After its release, “torch light” soon reached a million level of sales due to its high completion and game quality. The world has not interfered too much with the independent research and development of runic, but as a technical support, they are still needed to help improve their other games. Runic has been planning to make an MMO like “light of the torch”, but at present their ability can not achieve this ambitious goal, so they can only temporarily put it on hold. As they had money on hand, they took advantage of the heat to make a more complete sequel to the torch light. During this period, the host port of the first generation works was also taken over, so the light of the torch 2, which could have been released as soon as possible, could not be postponed. The players who have an impression should also remember that the second generation had a ticket jump. In 2012, “torch light 2” is just in front of the newly released “Diablo 3”. It’s hard to imagine that it’s a work made by an independent game team, and it’s true in front of “Diablo 3”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Why did the spiritual successor of Diablo, who was supposed to be a thriving company, get disbanded/59af4a558a514874b7961e24f744ddad.jpg" alt="Why did the spiritual successor of Diablo, who was supposed to be a thriving company, get disbanded"></p>
<h1 id="《Hob》"><a href="#《Hob》" class="headerlink" title="《Hob》"></a>《Hob》</h1><p>The success of torch light 2 has made runic one of the first-line development teams. In the next few years, runic has been trying to make a new game. They have a lot of inspiration and want to make a science fiction style game, but although the idea is very good, because the new plan failed to be recognized by all members of the studio, they know that if they can’t be like before “Light of the torch” is like “trying to make it work in one place”. It is likely that the quality of the game will be unsatisfactory. Most members of the team are very fond of the adventure game like legend of Zelda in their early years, so this time they no longer try their own unique skill of “random generation”, but intend to make a complete linear game, which is similar to Zelda, but also want to integrate their unique style. In this trend of thinking, a new game is born A new IP called hob.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Why did the spiritual successor of Diablo, who was supposed to be a thriving company, get disbanded/4fa5dcfe534f4a55b6e0da6ebe73c565.jpg" alt="Why did the spiritual successor of Diablo, who was supposed to be a thriving company, get disbanded"><br>Although runic wants to make a game similar to Zelda, he doesn’t want to make it too similar at the same time, so there is no reference object for the development of this game, and all needs to be tried by the development team from scratch, and the game has been changed again and again. In the end, “hob” became an action adventure game, and its growth system was more like an action game than an RPG game.<br>The game was released at the end of September 2017. The development team didn’t provide much publicity for this work. Instead, many media publicized it with “the latest work of the torch light development team”. Many players thought it would be a kind of dark ARPG game. As a result, the quality of the game itself was acceptable, but there were many defects due to the immature experience in many aspects. Therefore, the game played The sales volume of the play is not good, and runic has invested too much in the game, so that this time it failed to obtain the revenue in direct proportion to the payment. The development of the game took five years in total, but the final product was not in direct proportion to their five-year payment. This time, even the perfect world could not be saved. It was expected that runic would be disbanded So this time, it’s really because of runic’s slip, which leads to everlasting hatred.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Why did the spiritual successor of Diablo, who was supposed to be a thriving company, get disbanded/a098902b349746a0857a94e60d14ee07.jpg" alt="Why did the spiritual successor of Diablo, who was supposed to be a thriving company, get disbanded"><br>    concluding remarks<br>Fortunately, after the dissolution of runic, most of the members cooperated with some practitioners of another studio, gearbox, and re established the new studio, Monster Squad games. They learned from the failure of runic. They believed that for the independent game development team in today’s era, if a game wants to create long-term revenue, it needs to be long-term The game is updated and improved, and the game is operated in the form of similar online games. After the dissolution of runic, the IP of torch light was naturally handed over to the perfect. Perfect planned to hand over this IP to another studio and complete the MMO of torch light that runic had always wanted to do but failed to do.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Why did the spiritual successor of Diablo, who was supposed to be a thriving company, get disbanded/2267cb96e7df404fa7730c0ccb39f9a3.jpg" alt="Why did the spiritual successor of Diablo, who was supposed to be a thriving company, get disbanded"><br>In 2018, “torch light: front line” was officially released, and it is expected to have an opportunity to sell this year. According to the experience of foreign media line, it seems to give this game a very high evaluation, claiming that this is the best online design for the same type of ARPG works. I hope this game will bring surprises to the players in the future, and I also hope that the newly established monster square can be operated for a long time this time.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>At the E3 game exhibition, Ubisoft, a French game company, announced that it will launch its own game subscription service uplay + on September 3 this year. Players who subscribe to this service can directly experience most of Ubisoft’s games within the term, and even the upcoming new works can also download and play directly when they are launched, with a monthly fee of $14.99. Although the price is not expensive compared with the service provided by other manufacturers, it is not so cheap.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/You may earn blood, but I'm sure I'm not losing. Read the advantages and disadvantages of the game subscription system in an easy to understand way/4f8adfa9534946a19c913c7bb74b0540.jpg" alt="You may earn blood, but I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not losing. Read the advantages and disadvantages of the game subscription system in an easy to understand way"><br>According to the data, in 2018, the highest revenue subscription service in Europe and the United States was Playstation now on Sony PS host platform, with a monthly fee of $20. Although the price is double that of Microsoft Xbox game pass, it still can earn three times of XGP revenue. Throughout the whole game field, more and more manufacturers have started to launch this service, which is going to become the mainstream. For our players, is the game subscription good or bad?</p>
<h1 id="digital-products"><a href="#digital-products" class="headerlink" title="digital products"></a>digital products</h1><p>Subscription service has been popular in the field of Internet since a long time ago. For example, the “members” we can see on major video websites at ordinary times, as long as we have members, we can get more permissions on video websites, and we can watch more videos only when we pay for them. In the early years, video games only have offline purchase of entities as a channel. With the gradual progress of science and technology, digital games have gradually gained a larger proportion in the game market. After all, although the price of carving a CD-ROM in the early physical games is not so expensive, no matter how much it is to promote, transport, store or even sell, it needs to pay a certain fee, and the cost will inevitably increase Make itself perhaps not expensive game cost multiplied growth. When digital games come into being, most of the cost can be avoided, which undoubtedly reduces the pressure on game manufacturers, and the extra money can also be used in other places.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/You may earn blood, but I'm sure I'm not losing. Read the advantages and disadvantages of the game subscription system in an easy to understand way/a16fe8ba130e42079c1d8b3b54a6b3e2.jpg" alt="You may earn blood, but I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not losing. Read the advantages and disadvantages of the game subscription system in an easy to understand way"><br>Gamestop, a famous foreign game retailer, has closed many stores<br>Now the network level has begun to enter the 5g era, the network speed and quality have increased nearly ten times compared with the previous, and the significance of the existence of physical games is further weakened. Imagine that a game with a capacity of about 10g can be installed on your game device in just a few minutes or even seconds after it is paid. In the face of a physical version with the same or higher price, offline running or paying extra transportation costs, it is estimated that most people will choose the former. Let’s turn our thinking around for a moment and think about it. As a player, we only need to pay a small amount to experience hundreds of game works and even the newly launched 3A masterpieces. These games can sell at a higher price than the original ones. Isn’t this a loss business for developers?<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/You may earn blood, but I'm sure I'm not losing.

<p>#Why does   have subscription system?<br>From the perspective of developers, there is no difference between games and other real goods on the shelves, but at the same time, the biggest difference between games and real goods is that there is no substance, since there is no substance, there will be no “consumption” phenomenon. The author gives an example, for example, someone spent a little money to set up a member in a cosmetics store. One of the members’ privileges is that you can try all the products of the company without limit, so this person goes every day and consumes the products every day, which is undoubtedly a loss for the business. But this will not happen to video games, because video games are not substantive things, and paid subscription services can only exchange the right to use the game instead of the right to own it. This is like renting a game in the past. Although you only need to pay the rent and don’t need to pay the deposit to get the game, the condition without the deposit is that you can only play the game under the whole supervision of the network. When the time comes, you lose the game’s play authority. If you want to play next, you need to continue to pay, or directly buy the game in full, which is removed for the business There is almost no loss beyond the cost of developing games, and a profit can be made by the way.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/You may earn blood, but I'm sure I'm not losing.

Read the advantages and disadvantages of the game subscription system in an easy to understand way"><br>Apple arcade game subscription service<br>It seems that choosing the game subscription service is actually very profitable. You only need to pay a little money to experience hundreds of games, but in a limited time, how many games can players really fully experience? After all, you can’t play these hundreds of games at the same time. Maybe you are really good at spending a lot of time and clearing customs quickly. But if you play the game just to rush through customs, what’s the meaning of the game itself? In the view of players, subscription service may be blood earning, but for businesses, it is absolutely not a loss, and the blood earning is definitely businesses rather than players. In fact, it’s a very simple truth. If this service doesn’t earn money, what’s the need to launch it? And how can so many manufacturers adopt this marketing mode?<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/You may earn blood, but I'm sure I'm not losing.

<p>#What do the insiders think?<br>In the game related industries, most people support subscription services. After all, even the cheapest buy-out game is not as good as it used to be. Many players often feel regret after buying the game, so they want to refund. Refund is always a thankless job, which is time-consuming, laborious and not profitable. As a developer, it is natural to try to avoid this situation. The subscription system can solve this problem well. This game is not fun. If you change it, you don’t need to experience all the content in one breath, so it’s not easy to regret the players. This kind of feeling is like the former gives a bucket of chocolate to the players. Although they are addicted, they can’t eat it all at once. How to eat too much will make them sick. The control of the quantity depends on the players themselves. The latter is like giving a bucket of chocolate to the players little by little every day. It’s neither painful nor itchy. Although it’s not addictive, it’s better than nothing, but it can’t be pointed out that one day it suddenly disappears and looks good It makes people feel uncomfortable.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/You may earn blood, but I'm sure I'm not losing.

With more and more manufacturers joining in, it may be that in the future, players will not be divided into camps because of which one or which series, but around which group or another group of divisions, from the evaluation of the game itself to the evaluation of the manufacturer’s lineup. After all, players will not only pay to play a game, no doubt who’s game will win the favor of the players Who can stand out in this competition.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/You may earn blood, but I'm sure I'm not losing.

<p>#Conclusion<br>There is no doubt that the game subscription system will be a major trend in the future, whether it is the platform or the manufacturer has already put into action or is still planning. Apple’s app arcade, Ubisoft’s uplay +, and even Google’s “cloud game” stadia, the lineup is undoubtedly expanding. Although this is a good thing for developers, it can’t guarantee that it’s a good thing for players. As mentioned above, players are bound to pay attention to a certain game lineup to choose consumption in the future, but who can guarantee that in the future, there will not be those players who make up a lot of money in this mode.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/You may earn blood, but I'm sure I'm not losing.

Read the advantages and disadvantages of the game subscription system in an easy to understand way"><br>After all, the traditional business model of buyout system will not disappear in any case, and the game subscription as an optional item is very much to choose to buy or to depend on the players themselves. After all, nowadays many players choose to buy a game with studio plot to a large extent, and choosing to buy is undoubtedly to support their favorite studio; but they can’t usually buy Games For players who spend too much time and money, subscription may be a good choice. As for the subscription system, I hold a wait-and-see attitude, and I will buy the game I like directly, because I really don’t like the feeling that what I paid for doesn’t belong to me; as for how you see it, please express your opinions in the comment area.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>In November last year, a game producer named tobyfox finally updated his twitter after a long silence, and this is more than a few. He said to his friends who followed him: “please come back in 24 hours, and I want to share a good thing that you will be interested in.” 24 hours later, tobyfox updated the news as scheduled, and released a game called deltarune (triangle Rune) to the outside world, and released the demo of the game, which exploded the whole game circle in an instant.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Who said that good games can't be made without big production What kind of magic does under the legend contain/32fdf6c6aa02411eb4f9ccfeb6cbaef8.jpg" alt="Who said that good games can&#39;t be made without big production What kind of magic does under the legend contain"><br>This game is not so well made. It’s just a pixel style RPG game, but it has aroused the cheers of many players. Curious people will ask, why can such a game arouse such a strong response of players? It’s not surprising that the game producer, Toby fox, launched a popular masterpiece four years ago, called “underground”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Who said that good games can't be made without big production What kind of magic does under the legend contain/789cb9f58374495f95e2e6469a9aa52d.jpg" alt="Who said that good games can&#39;t be made without big production What kind of magic does under the legend contain"></p>
<h1 id="follow-the-feeling"><a href="#follow-the-feeling" class="headerlink" title="follow the feeling"></a>follow the feeling</h1><p>As early as 1994, edge, a British magazine, published such a review. The reviewed game work was the classic FPS game “destroyer”, which was popular at that time. The editor of the magazine praised the operating system and strong screen performance of the game in the review, but denied the depth and connotation of the game. After all, “destroyer” is a pure shooting game There is no plot or depth, just turn all the moving things in front of you. “If you can communicate with those monsters, maybe you can make friends with them. That’s so interesting,” the editor said As soon as the comments were made, they triggered discussion in the game circle, and everyone laughed at the editor. Can you imagine that? In an age when playing games is just for fun, there are people who want to make friends with enemies. More than 20 years later, the game producer named tobyfox actually made this concept into a game. This time, he was not ridiculed, but admired and praised by many players.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Who said that good games can't be made without big production What kind of magic does under the legend contain/e71b6f77c2014dc19bd56f728199ab1a.jpg" alt="Who said that good games can&#39;t be made without big production What kind of magic does under the legend contain"><br>Edge original<br>In short, Toby wanted to make a dialogue program at first, but when he was doing it, he felt that he could add a combat system to it. Adding a combat system meant that he could have characters, scenes and plots. The more he did it, the more it looked like a game. That’s why “under the legend” is so unique. Because it’s not developed as a game, there are so many Different from video games. In Toby’s cognition, he has been exposed to many different types of video games with different styles. Since he intends to make a game, he will put together all the excellent settings of his favorite interesting games to make a work that can subvert people’s cognition.<br>After all, “under the legend” is just a turn RPG game, but it can pass the customs without any blame or upgrade, and the screen and UI of the game, even the game menu, are extremely simple, even the game background and world view are very old-fashioned. However, no one knows whether the design is the author’s intention, and these seemingly disdainful contents instead become The camouflage of the game.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Who said that good games can't be made without big production What kind of magic does under the legend contain/c947afc8adfc44268f4b7537f4679ec3.jpg" alt="Who said that good games can&#39;t be made without big production What kind of magic does under the legend contain"><br>Although the picture of “under the legend” is simple and crude, it is not so bad</p>
<p>#Dialogue with monsters<br>Just mentioned that the game can not even kill a monster without upgrading to a level. Of course, there are also settings that can fight. You can also kill all monsters as a brave man to kill for the people. However, the design of “can not kill a monster” completely subverts the logical thinking of the whole play. In the game, the player plays a human who slips into the monster world from the human world. The goal is to find a way to return to the human world. Your adventure starts from this. It seems that this is a more conventional development.<br>The beginning of the game has briefly introduced the background of the game: humans and monsters once ruled the world together, but for some reasons, there was a war between the two sides, and finally humans won the victory, and the monsters were sealed underground. If you look closely, the game doesn’t say that the two sides have a war for any reason, which means that one of them must have an idea that they don’t belong to the group, but they don’t tell you who the other side is. They just tell you that human beings have defeated monsters and sealed them underground, giving you the illusion that “human beings are just, monsters must be evil” What if we reverse the whole thinking? What if it’s humans who are evil and monsters who are passive?<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Who said that good games can't be made without big production What kind of magic does under the legend contain/47293ba5e48e495bb7c82302d11ba591.jpg" alt="Who said that good games can&#39;t be made without big production What kind of magic does under the legend contain"><br>With this unusual thinking, the story and play method of the whole “under the legend” is formed. In short, it is not necessary to think in accordance with common sense. In the whole game and the traditional Japanese RPG game, you can try to interact with monsters who want to attack you, so as to reduce their hostility to you, and use mercy to monsters when the time is right, so as to end the fight of the game. If the player doesn’t want to fight but doesn’t want to be hurt, the game also introduces a barrage system similar to “Oriental project”. As long as the enemy evades the attack from the enemy in the turn, the damage can be avoided. It’s called “the enemy who bends without fighting”. When you put down your prejudice and try to contact with these monsters, you will even find that these monsters are not only harmless to humans and animals, but even richer than human emotions.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Who said that good games can't be made without big production What kind of magic does under the legend contain/9615a75143f748b1b5134cd095cd9a31.jpg" alt="Who said that good games can&#39;t be made without big production What kind of magic does under the legend contain"><br>Characters with distinct personalities are hard to forget once they play</p>
<p>#Take everything into consideration<br>To a great extent, the design of “under the legend” refers to the classic RPG game “mother” in Nintendo’s early years. The latter is also a work that doesn’t play according to the routine. As for how many elements in “mother” are paid homage to, even the author himself can’t say. After many players have played this work, the first feeling is usually not how novel the design and ideas of this game are, but that they feel like they have been played by the game.<br>Many bridge sections in the game give the players a feeling that the game itself wants to break the dimension wall and talk directly with the players off the screen. Generally, we call this setting “meta”. For example, if the player kills a key NPC, and then the reader returns to the beginning of the battle, there will often be some different plots from the first experience. Due to the unique combat system, the process of the game is divided into several routes. If the players are almost crazy to kill in the game, they will even be automatically deleted by the game, giving the players a sense of substitution of “this is a real world”.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Who said that good games can't be made without big production What kind of magic does under the legend contain/843bd85a92cd4bc287d9f2dafc66a809.jpg" alt="Who said that good games can&#39;t be made without big production What kind of magic does under the legend contain"><br>Game mother game screen<br>The most brilliant design for the author is interactivity. The author seems to take every action that a player can take into account in every bridge section, so that every action of the player can get feedback. For example, if you don’t have space in your backpack, if you choose to buy a hot dog, the boss will put the hot dog on your head because you don’t have space; or if you choose to discard or use the gifts or props given by NPC, you will also be criticized and questioned by NPC. Strictly speaking, the game enriches the interaction details of the game to the greatest extent. The last time I felt this feeling was in the classic American RPG game “gate of Bode”. Players can decide how to carry out the task by themselves, while “under the legend” added “feedback” to this possibility, so as to improve the game’s sense of substitution more recently.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Who said that good games can't be made without big production What kind of magic does under the legend contain/011c447776024e6cbd71487237dc9174.jpg" alt="Who said that good games can&#39;t be made without big production What kind of magic does under the legend contain"><br>Every player’s choice in the game is not meaningless</p>
<p>#Conclusion<br>Toby creates the game’s sense of substitution for the players to the greatest extent in “under the legend”. The purpose is to encourage the players to choose the most peaceful one among the numerous game routes, so as to give the players a sense of “they are the real existence of the general”, and all kinds of unique settings and systems are all in this direction, but at the same time, Toby does not want to pass this way In this way, the freedom of players is restricted, and the playing methods and systems of regular games are added. If we integrate all these design ideas together, we can easily find that the author wants to express an idea of subverting the traditional game design ideas.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/Who said that good games can't be made without big production What kind of magic does under the legend contain/7cbb85c9deb84d71a5916aea57f2e351.jpg" alt="Who said that good games can&#39;t be made without big production What kind of magic does under the legend contain"><br>The author’s Avatar in the game is a dog<br>Is the game flawed? Of course, there are, but the highlights of the game will cover the shortcomings of the game tightly. At first, the game began crowdfunding in KickStarter, with a goal of only $5000. However, relying on the author’s unique ideas, the game raised nearly ten times more money than the goal. However, compared with many 3A high-cost masterpieces, the cost of “under the legend” is still a small problem. Under such conditions, Toby still stepped on a number of 3A games through the quality of the game itself, and drew a ear of melon severely. There was no high-quality painting, no big production, but he still made the highest praise rate of “under the legend” until now. As for Toby’s new work “triangle Rune”, the official version of which is suitable for launch, the author has no idea. Whether this new work can reproduce the dazzling achievements of “under the legend”, please wait and see.</p>

    <title>We have become the most hated of each other, and call of duty is becoming battlefield</title>
    <url>/2019/11/08/We%20have%20become%20the%20most%20hated%20of%20each%20other,%20and%20call%20of%20duty%20is%20becoming%20battlefield/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Recently, Kathy elcasey, chief marketing officer of nip of E-sports club, after watching the demonstration of the multiplayer mode of “call of Duty: modern war”, expressed her own view: the playing method and style of “call of duty” are more and more like “battlefield”, while the playing method of “battlefield” is not satisfactory though it has been improved in every generation Already good enough, hope EA can step up the pace to improve the game playing method.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/We have become the most hated of each other, and call of duty is becoming battlefield/1830d472a3304ce9add915fcb0e8c8fc.jpg" alt="We have become the most hated of each other, and call of duty is becoming battlefield"><br>Why does the marketing officer of an E-sports Club give directions to the game that can’t be related to himself? Because he has another identity: former global brand manager of EA company. This is true. In an interview with foreign media a while ago, IW, the development team of the call of Duty series, said that they would add a multiplayer model to the new work, which could hold 100 people, and named it “ground war”, to divide the players into battalions of 50 people on each side for confrontation. You should know that the highlight of the battlefield series is the large-scale operation of 32v32, but this time the number of people in the call of duty has nearly doubled compared with the battlefield series, and it not only retains the original fighting style in playing method, but also increases the “sense of presence” in the game. If both of them can be done well, it is undoubtedly a danger for battlefield Things.</p>
<h1 id="dice-yes-EA-wrong"><a href="#dice-yes-EA-wrong" class="headerlink" title="dice yes, EA wrong"></a>dice yes, EA wrong</h1><p>Let’s review the experience of battlefield 5 from its release to the present: in short, although the game background has been pulled back to World War II after many years, it seems that this World War II is not the same as what we remember. There are many settings in the game that are extremely against the background of the World War II era, such as women soldiers walking everywhere, weapons and equipment that are inconsistent with the times, and so on. These problems have been controversial since the game was just released, which makes people really confused about which parallel universe World War II it is. Players have launched a petition on the Internet, hoping that EA can respect history and modify the settings, but EA didn’t mean to change the settings back, on the contrary, the high-level officials have publicly expressed that “the people who let us modify the game have no education.” These scenes are all possible things. If you don’t like them, you can not buy them.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/We have become the most hated of each other, and call of duty is becoming battlefield/d1bcec16d0394d12b743f1ac5cd4764f.jpg" alt="We have become the most hated of each other, and call of duty is becoming battlefield"><br>In the second picture on the left, it seems that the British female soldiers equipped with prosthetics and sniper guns never appeared in World War II<br>It’s hard to imagine that the disastrous comments came from the top leaders of EA. Since EA officials have said that we can not buy if we don’t like it, then we don’t buy it. The players decided to speak with practical actions. The main players of “battlefield” series are mainly distributed in overseas host platforms, so the sales volume of the first week of the physical version of the game is not even higher than that of the previous generation of work “battlefield: hard battle”, so EA’s share price has also plummeted all the way, and the senior leaders who made the disaster speech have no choice but to resign. As for the operation of EA, dice, the developer, did not give any response and expression, which is not hard to understand. After all, they are only employees of EA. How to do the game can only follow the leader’s arrangement, and they are only responsible for bowing their heads and working silently.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/We have become the most hated of each other, and call of duty is becoming battlefield/dadd34fa78db45ca8e0d6d5b5ef9ea32.jpg" alt="We have become the most hated of each other, and call of duty is becoming battlefield"><br>No discussion on the historical accuracy of the game is allowed in battlefield 5<br>Now that EA is so eloquent about this, what about the game itself? In the early stage of selling, the game almost went online in a “preemptive experience” manner. At first, only Britain and Germany were involved, and the content was extremely scarce. EA said that the follow-up content would be updated at the time in the historical records, which is called “the tide of war”. In fact, this is the fake of the second explosion table designed by EA to slow down the update speed of the game and leave a step for itself Install. The actual experience and quality of the game are OK, and the rhythm and design feel of the game are ideal. However, the content of the game is too few, and the constant emergence of bugs has a great impact on the experience of the game, and the so-called “wave of war” is just like squeezing toothpaste.<br>It has been nearly a year since the game was updated. Although there is a “flaming storm” model called “the most gorgeous escape in history”, the “chicken eating” craze has subsided by that time. Many people are already tired of aesthetic appreciation. After all, the core content is not good, and these additional content is not good No matter how gorgeous it is, it won’t help.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/We have become the most hated of each other, and call of duty is becoming battlefield/57ec050edce5434392edaf415209c508.jpg" alt="We have become the most hated of each other, and call of duty is becoming battlefield"><br>Publicity map of “fire storm” mode</p>
<p>#Come back?<br>It is undeniable that the call of Duty series is almost equal to Japan’s “the brave fight against the dragon” in the minds of European and American players, which can be called a national FPS game. Many works have reached tens of millions of sales, dominating the sales list of European and American host market for many years in a row. Although the word-of-mouth is not good in the player group, the players should buy or will buy. From the second generation of the series, in order to increase the life and playability of the game, the series has joined the mode of multi player battle. With the passage of time, the heat of multi player battle has gradually surpassed that of single player battle. Even when the previous generation of the work “black action 4” directly eliminated single player battle and made a pure battle game.<br>For a long time, the multiplayer mode of the call of Duty series has been a small map fast-paced street battle. Compared with the battlefield series, there are obvious differences in the battle rhythm and playing methods, which also leads to mutual contempt between the two sides. However, the new work now will directly upgrade the battlefield scale to a higher level than battlefield, which is absolutely true for developers It’s a bold attempt, but for players, it’s hard to avoid some bottomless.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/We have become the most hated of each other, and call of duty is becoming battlefield/8a6835b47acc4ee2b6be8c2cae0c596e.jpg" alt="We have become the most hated of each other, and call of duty is becoming battlefield"><br>The picture of multi person mode in the restart edition of modern war<br>After the magnificent ending of the trilogy of modern war, the background of the call of Duty series has always been jumping in different periods, sometimes falling back to the Vietnam War in the Second World War, sometimes flying back to the near future and even the future, only one ghost has adopted the modern background. The author doesn’t need to elaborate on how popular the trilogy of modern war is. Fans of this series hope for and don’t want to have new works. After all, it’s a pity that this hot series ends like this, but the story of the trilogy has been completed. Players are afraid that activism will try to squeeze the IP value and smash the signboard.<br>In terms of mobile TV, it has come up with but dare not come out of this series. However, the voice of this series is really high, and it is inevitable that the future background will be used for many years. In order not to offend people but also to ensure the quality of the game, mobile TV has chosen to restart IP and keep the original settings to create a new story, so that both old and new players All of them can be readily accepted.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/We have become the most hated of each other, and call of duty is becoming battlefield/625e649be321484d8e2cfb741bcfa45c.jpg" alt="We have become the most hated of each other, and call of duty is becoming battlefield"><br>This ghost is not the ghost</p>
<p>#Conclusion<br>At last, the new action video is willing to replace the new engine. After all, more than ten old engines have been repaired, which is also the most criticized point of the players. After the change of the new engine, there has been obvious progress in both the picture performance and the sound effect performance. The 50v50 mode to be launched this time is to retain the original core mode and the additional content beyond the system mechanism, and meet the needs of different players in different ways.<br><img src="http://maiygu.xyz/2019/11/08/We have become the most hated of each other, and call of duty is becoming battlefield/2498a3c977394f0daf38a117a9379e17.jpg" alt="We have become the most hated of each other, and call of duty is becoming battlefield"><br>Ironically, in this year’s update, “battlefield 5” added 5v5 small-scale operations, but now the scale of “call of duty”, which has always been the main small-scale operation, has suddenly surpassed the scale of “battlefield”. The two originally despised each other, but now it is about to become the most hated look on the other side. However, this does not mean that the use of large-scale “call of duty” must be the same as that of “battlefield”. At least it seems that the fans of the series still give positive feedback on the new mode at present, but what is the actual experience? It is necessary to wait for the actual sale of the game before commenting.</p>
